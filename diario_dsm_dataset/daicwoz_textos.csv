thank you mmm k i'm doing good thank you i'm from los angeles oh great i live in west los angeles the west side it's alright i xxx no i live alone so i love it i'm from here so i grew up here it's natural the weather um well the weather it's always good it's never it's never bad uh um there's always something to do it's rarely a dull moment the traffic the traffic is horrible well probably traffic is horrible in almost any major city but i hate the traffic not really i mean i have enough things going on here so if i travel it's usually somewhere that's within driving distance i studied uh business i did no i've i've been done for a few years so i haven't gone to school for a while one of these days i'll go back to graduate school but my dream job would be to just work for myself and making lots of money um i don't know i don't really have a dream job just something that i can i can work under my own terms and get paid decently and and be in a creative creative environment um i don't know i think it's just a matter of finding the right situation so right now eh it's been people are a little conservative about what they want so and how they want it so it's a little tougher than it seems <se> it should be but i don't know i think when the situation's right i don't think it's too difficult yep i work as an assistant <as> administrative assistant through a temp agency so it's just basically i get sent out to do uh to do desk jobs  um yes and no i mean i feel like i feel like i could do more but you know it works so  you know yeah i'm pretty close i mean they're around so um god really mad stupid people just basically doing just doing anything to annoy me um that's basically <ba> that's the big thing just just irritating stupid people <laughter> who just do things just to provoke provoke me for no reason at all um what's a good example just random people who who think it's funny to just sit there and get a rise out of me just it doesn't have to be one any specific situation it's just people who just think it's funny to i think they're just generally sadistic and they just think it's it's funny to to just prod you like it's like poking a stick at an angry dog knowing that they know how to they just wanna push your buttons for no reason so uh god i don't remember i with those situations i usually try not to remember <laughter> when when it happens i just i just let it go and just like the past is the past i just tend not to look back what do you mean okay god what do i do to relax i like to run i like to go to the gym listen to music i have a lot of musician friends so i just so i'm usually around musicians so anything of that sort i like i like everything from punk rock art to tattoos to just anything that's that's generally art and creative who's been a positive <pos> i think it's just friends in general who who seem to who seem to do well and i think they they're very inspiring and which is sometimes a a bit tough in in a town like los angeles where i think everybody's on the go trying to accomplish their own goals so they don't it's sometimes hard to find someone who's gonna be uplifting or try to be inspiring so i don't really have anybody in particular but people have kind of brought up things here and there you know just like hey instead of instead of doing this how about doing that or hey you're good at this why aren't you doing that or something like that just you know i'm always looking for new opportunities so they always point out things that maybe i might i could do differently instead of just being negative saying hey don't do that that's no that's why are you doing that it's a waste of time um i guess it depends on who you talk to i'm i'm okay at it i could probably work at that um i don't know i mean i can i i think i can do better at it well back to the point about people provoking me so i mean i try not to blow steam and let them get under my skin so i just usually try not to let it get to me but i don't know i guess with temper i guess it depends on how i handle my stress lately i've been better at it just because i think my situation's been a little bit better no no no um nothing major i mean maybe when i was younger i could've traveled more or i could've worked towards something that paid better job-wise but i mean those are all things that i think at any point in life you always think like well i coulda shoulda would've done but you know but then again i think that's natural for anybody i mean i could i could've become a banker or i could've become a lawyer or a doctor and made about ten times the money that i make now but but then again i don't like the law and i don't like medicine so so i'm it wasn't meant to be so yeah so um i think i think my in my life i knew that i there's a lot of things i have <ha> there's more dislikes <laughter> than likes so i kinda narrowed it down to what am i good at and what am i not good at and what am i gonna work well or who who am i gonna work well with and who will i not work well with so i kind of i kinda sorted out and then the list kind of mmm kind of answered itself so no it i don't think it was hard but it was just but i think it was a real reality check and i think it it's kind of a good thing 'cause sometimes trying to conform to doing things that doesn't really fit you doesn't make sense it's like trying to shove a a round peg into a square a square hole and it's like it just no matter how you try to shove it in it's not gonna go in so sometimes it's just might as well go down a path that seems to work better for you memorable experiences um hmm i think it's just i don't really have like any one in particular i think i think every day is almost like a memorable experience whether it's positive or negative i think it's just everything from getting it just just the fact that i got a job and i can i can take care of myself is already almost like a memorable experience maybe for the average person it it sounds stupid but you know i think just the fact that i'm able i'm able to get this far in life without like completely self-destructing is already an accomplishment so i feel like i've gotten somewhere maybe not to not maybe not to the point to the average person they might think like well why aren't you a millionaire but you know what not everybody can be a millionaire yeah um when was the last time i really felt happy um i don't know i'm not really someone who's like i don't have any real high highs or low lows i mean i haven't hit any lows so i mean i i don't know i'm usually pretty i feel like i'm a level person and i'm pretty happy <ha> every day i feel like if i accomplish one thing then i'm pretty happy so i guess to answer the question probably mmm probably yesterday i just feel like if i if i'm able to accomplish something then then hey i'm happy i don't know i don't really have a best friend but i mean i well to answer the question generally friends i think they would say that i'm very <ver> pretty outgoing i'm pretty determined i'm trying you know i try to you know i try to interact as much as possible i'm always out networking as much as possible so i don't know i guess that's basically what i think they would describe me as okay no problem alright bye,0
fine uh colorado mhm uh career career possibilities uh paralegal uh for further education for the weather for a friend [laughter]  not often at all now every few years oh the weather uh the beach sunsets at the beach uh the thought of uh career possibilities um an educated group of people sophisticated market it is an adjustment uh to to come here a lot of people misjudge it a little bit it's a laid back appearing town but it's actually very um uh sensitive to you know uh success and commericalization and that kind of thing so you have to keep up the pace uh that is a little bit harder i think when you first make the adjustment and pretty soon it becomes obvious that it's another market that you just have to work hard in like you you do in others oh be an attorney [laughter] mhm oh just because you have the uh the power you can use uh you know skills to be able to affect people live people's lives in a more dramatic way than just being uh an assistant in that field oh uh a lot of it is not around anymore just have brothers and sisters out of state so not particularly close right now uh mm dishonesty unkindness  lack of sympathy uh insensitivity you know uh very good if anything i'm i'm uh regressive that way [laughter] mhm oh wow uh oh just a friend a friend who is who is right now a has a fabulous job is uh spending too much money that he needs to save uh through uh a work situation just a a work connection  mutual friends mhm uh close close now we spend time we have uh we go out and have fun sometimes uh walk walk on the beach uh you know uh shop in beach areas is kind of fun rodeo drive occasionally and uh and see films art art galleries oh uh my daughter i just have one daughter who graduated u_c_l_a law school and uh i raised her totally alone without any help so it seemed like an accomplishment that was was worth it the the two jobs and the work uh i think it's difficult i think it's a difficult job that takes a lot more work than most people give it credit for if you wanna do it right you know it's always second guessing your behavior and that kind of thing uh just uh i'd say peer pressure it can totally alter [al] alter anything a parent has tried to put into a child that's good scrubbed_entry so that was a really bad time for us um i think it depends on which neighborhood or state you're in or the the uh i i think they're a little misguided i think a little uninspired [unin] uninspired right now i think they're being weighed down by the concerns of the wars and um and things like that and i think they can probably use a  uh a common goal a common you know now a team uh as as oppposed to just being more separated group than a family [fam] once they were i think you know kind of uninspired right now um i worry sometimes about you know work issues but it's pretty pretty easy um no i i don't feel like i'm not sleeping i i just you know will occasionally worry about something at work oh gosh about a couple weeks ago oh just uh you know unfortunately we have to worry you know i'm fortunate this isn't easier it's just cooperation between people uh it solves most everything you know so you always wanna have that around you um just stressed yeah stressed more stressed mhm um yeah fatigue has uh a lot of uh you know a lot of implications for just not feeling like yourself or misjudging things that you might judge differently if you were more well rested uh not depression um probably yeah i was that was considered a possibility i had an employment lawsuit several years ago and and uh actually litigated it and won the settlement um something about whistleblower thing implications [im] implications of that and um and i was kind of harrassed about it and so i found when i got out of it i couldn't find work right away in my own field so i had to go into a different field go back to u_c_l_a and get a new uh professional direction and i found myself fearful sometimes that it's gonna happen again you know and you think that would never happen again you know um just that i was noticing that i was noticing i was feeling very uh in my paralegal class i had a a section about employment law and there was a a very complicated filing i had done with great a deal of work and study for my case but once faced with it again in that class setting i just i just couldn't get it done it was a late paper from me and i realized i was traumatized by having to go through that again um that you know yeah post traumatic stress sometimes comes later after the adrenaline dies down from what i understand and um so i think it was just uh it was just hitting me later you know that i was having to face that paper again and wow you know no adrenaline just wow there is a xxxx back back just uh just extreme uh you know avoidance of getting something done that should've been easy for me  and uh and thinking about it as thoroughly as i should've or studying it or putting it off uh putting the feeling of going through that paper that type of paper even if it's just a class assignment again you know well um not lately um you know back then for sure when that happened which was about ten years ago now it was settled in court about seven years ago now and uh yeah it was it was effective you know it was effective in the way you view most everything and in your confidence and that kinda thing i'm sorry [laughter] repeat the question uh peaceful do i feel peaceful well yeah i was peaceful that it that it's settled uh but but angry that it ever happened so it's hard to i'll probably not ever feel peaceful about that issue ever it always the mention of it always makes me angry that i had to go through that yeah i don't think so i tried everything to avoid it [laughter] you know and so uh uh i think that's that was aggravating for me too because i'm a patient person realistic and um and i tried everything to avoid uh confrontation in the matter but it was just required to try to you know help me cover the damage to our lives my daughter's life i uh not now maybe one time in my life not now you if you can't communicate uh you know if you could communicate you could overcome people's perceptions or their judgments of you if you can effectively explain something and and uh it will help you overcome other perceptions of yourself that others might normally have judgments for age or anything like that um well just raising a daughter extendedly you know or or uh you know just um the experience of thinking thinking that that was a after all the years that was a success her graduating from law school yeah uh just like a lot of work had a good ending uh  you know happy glad that it was fulfilled wishes or or dreams for this child were fulfilled you know that and she was able to make that success wow um [laughter] i i i tend to be kind of happy with life 'cause the alternative is gonna harm harm your you know your ability to succeed so i try to force happiness i guess in in most every situation in my life route i find something about it uh when i lost some weight recently that made me really happy i travel a little bit locally i traveled more when i was younger i really enjoyed that but just been too busy in the last few years just new places um ability to take the worries we have every day work  or concerns and kind of put them away for a while and see something new  you know kind of the way i'm going back to uh colorado san riosco went through vale  and uh and spent the night there and um and it was just during spring when there aren't many skiiers and it was just beautiful and very quiet a lot of restaurants with the decks and open in the mountains and it was beautiful yeah wow uh just um ardent i'm hard working loyal uh um creative um just seeing something that you're creating you're trying to create uh becomes something you hoped the picture would be you know if if that's the case you know just hard work uh just fulfilled or or presented itself in a certain way that you know it makes you happy to my daughter um very [ver] pretty close she just had a baby she's in the bay area she send me pictures all the time okay bye,0

yes quite well feel good los angeles california here mhm one of the few um native born los angelinos i uh home school my ten year old son and uh i'm a home maker i have five children and married twenty two years mhm so that's a full time job huh uh somewhat we can we went to israel about two months ago um for a pilgrimmage with our church yeah so i would say yes i've traveled a bit uh well most recently we like two months ago went to israel for a pilgrimmage we were gone about nine days and it was fabulous it was we spent the first five days in chorazine which is near the uh galilee and in a place called uh uh i mean the the name of the area is chorazine but uh we stayed in a place called adonis galilea which is a um a house for that welcomes um christian uh pilgrims as well as jewish pilgrims um i i enjoy like really the most important thing i enjoy is like meeting the people and and of course seeing the the history i mean especially israel i mean it's the  it's totally ancient but um most most i enjoy is is the the people i think to uh get a better understanding of how different cultures um live no not at all just don't i you know all my life i've always been open and and uh willing to socialize and i remember my younger brother always um joking and saying that i i would talk to anybody and i will i'll talk to just about anybody just because i enjoy learning about other people um most of the time like by the end of the day after i've cooked dinner and we've had dinner together as a family um i there's a word game on the computer that i like to play for a little while and then um watch t_v have a cocktail with my husband and just relax that's what we do and you know 'cause we have a lot going on we don't stay up too late so i like to watch crime dramas um really mad probably not a lot um i get frustrated with for example my daughter does not clean up her room almost ever so that that gets me angry but um in terms of like really um getting like heatedly angry i mean other than like little things that my children do to you know especially my oldest child who's twenty one you know he can be confrontational so other than that nothing gets me like really angry haven't i haven't haven't felt that um contributing to society helping uh helping to raise um responsible people i guess um and of course the love and the affection and the um the fun and the excitement that goes with it of all the stages that go i mean like really right now i'm in a stage where my children are either adults or teenagers i only have i have one eleven year old and the rest are all teenagers and adults so it's really fun because we're able to um talk about current events and all kinds of stuff that's going on in the world and you know have have uh challenging discussions and that sort of thing so it's it's a different level than when you're taking care of babies and you know changing diapers and that kind of stuff the hardest thing is that it's twenty four seven um you're never not a parent you know it's and so you have to accept that and that's i remember when i first with my first child um thinking you know when i brought him home from the hospital this is it i mean there's no going back you you cannot um change i mean i guess you could if you did something horrible but i mean under normal circumstances you can't change um that and it's a permanent thing and um it it it uh in some ways it takes away your freedom but in other ways it give you a different sort of freedom mhm always i'm sorry i didn't get what you said um some of the things that've been a positive influence in my life most importantly my church um and my faith uh but also my husband he's been a really um he's kind of he's very like logical thinking and very you know grounded so when if i get emotional or i get upset about something he's always we balance each other out likewise if he's upset about something i'm able to balance him out it's been a that's been a a great gift in my life um i don't i i don't think i'd be categorized as somebody with a a temper um occasionally i i occasionally i get angry but i don't like have like rarely do i have outbursts um i'm more more likely to you know to say what i feel not let it build up so with you know like my husband and i don't rarely fight like have arguments that are yelling and screaming or anything like that it almost never happens because i i like i said i'm more of a type of person that communicates on the spot so if i'm thinking something i usually communicate it right away instead of letting it build up um usually i'm arguing with my older son because he um you know he thinks he knows everything he's twenty one years old so he has the know it all mentality  and i'm just telling him that he doesn't know it all and you know as life goes on he'll learn more he's very confident and very self uh self uh what's the word self assured and so he thinks that you know everything he does is correct and he still has a lot of learning to do that's all mhm it is it can be mhm i think um that many of them are um spoiled and live in an environment of uh of instant gratification um which i think is gonna be um detrimental to the to the future of this country but um you know given that with all the technology we have there's really not any way to go back so i i have um hope that um they will i mean i think this country was built on on uh hard work and and ethics and uh hopefully our our the next generation and the the generations after that can maintain that um that standard of living i don't know if it's possible mm as loving nurturing um funny we laugh a lot and um caring honest things that uh i mean my best i have  well actually my best friend is it's two people it's two sisters that i grew up with and um we i for some years took care of their mother who has alzheimers before my parents got sick so i had a very close have a very close relationship with them still do and so um i'm considered the fourth sister so i would say that those are my best friends and and um we love each other very much it's a good relationship no no yes most mostly mm minorly depression it was more anxiety um probably um um it's probably been five or six years i mean i've had if off and on all my life but it was never diagnosed originally like as a teenager i think is when i first had started with the anxiety but um other than that i i you know so depression kind of goes with anxiety if it's not under control um but now it's under control so i have a great huh um no i think it was what they call free [flee] float free floating anxiety more of a of of uh organic um reason for it in other words there there was a chemical imbalance  in my brain i've been feeling pretty good actually the holidays were great um we had a  good family gatherings a little stressed because um we're making a big decision right now to help my parents out um my dad is really sick um and we've offered to move in with them they have a big home but we would have to do a lot of some renovation and some to help and some obviously moving around and so we're in the throws of that and um so that's a big big change but i'm looking forward to it because really don't want my parents to be alone as they get they're in their eighties so as they get closer to death i want to have my family there with them um not easy usually all of my life i think i've always i mean i'm not i've always had um at least i wake up at least once in the middle of the night um to go to the bathroom basically and uh other than that i mean no now i sleep well i mean other than that i sleep well but sometimes if i wake up like really early in the morning then i can't go back to sleep  i'll get up and maybe do some work on the computer and then go back to bed and go back to sleep idepends on what my schedule is and if the kids are have to be at the school early and there's a lot of factors yeah sometimes it does mm probably basically the same i think i might complain a bit like oh i'm tired or my body hurts or whatever you know but um i think overall probably the same my kids know i'll be i'll tell me kids oh i'm really tired and they'll understand my older daughter will be really helpful they my other daughter will try to cook dinner or something like that so you know they may pitch in a little bit more uh not really not not no not really not anything significant huh um actually yes i do i do feel like therapy is useful um well uh we had a situation with my daughter um she also suffers from anxiety and um we have had her in therapy for some time and we just recently we're about to finish a group with her that was a six month um uh group for d_b_t it's called and it's like a  it's the first time they it's the first time they're documenting using it with teenagers and um it's been really good it's been very helpful it's just all about how to live in the moment and how to you know actual physical and mental um strategies to keep your uh keep you from your mind from going crazy you know worrying about things or you know in this case some of the kids have tried to harm themselves or whatever so um that's the focus of the therapy and it's been really good my husband and i both have been going with our daughter and it's been really um really informational and really helpful i think oh my daughter was um she was in a bad way she was you know suffering a lot and we knew it and um we acted on it that's all um like really joyful and happy i would say probably when probably it would be in israel when we renewed our marriage vows in the the at the in knaan  uh so um you know where the wedding of kana took place that was really moving and beautiful um and it was it happened that our anniversary was we left on our anniversary day flew to israel so it was right at the same time it was beautiful very meaningful and other than that i would say you know like uh other joyful occasions have been you know like christmas and you know family gatherings and you know my dad's birthday turned eighty three on christmas eve you know that kinda thing so um um that's an interesting question i would say um once i get like things done that i need to do like if i'm have a lot of chores [ch] a lot of either work to do around the house or errands to run once i get them done i feel like a sense of accomplishment you know much like i mean i worked for many years in a as an administrative manager at u_c_l_a and um you know once you get a project done or you get your whatever month end stuff done or if there's a lot of different things you have to meet deadlines there's uh that feeling of like yeah i got it done you know so i think that would be you know for me the most um most recent um way of feeling good and feeling you know like feeling accomplished dream job hm i think i've already lived it i'm also a birth doula and um yeah and um so i've attended a lot of births and now i really only do it for family and friends and um it's the most rewarding thing you could possibly ask to be involved in the birth the bringing of new life into this world so i would say that's probably was my was a dream job and i didn't know it i trained much after you know i did my managerial stuff and um was awesome it is and was awesome so i don't work at at a hospital anymore actually the hospital that i worked at is now closed but um i like i said i do it for family members um i attended a friend of mine's birth by accident she uh she had had the same o_b as i did with all my children and um i came to bring food for her husband when she was in labor we were you know close friends and her labor picked up quite a bit when i got there you know she wanted me to stay she didn't want me to leave i hadn't planned on it so that was the first birth that i had attended outside of you know myself giving birth which is a whole different experience so after that i was really interesting interested in possibly study un nurse midwifery but then i discovered this thing called being a doula which is really gives you even a lot more hands on uh one on one contact with the patient which is what i like so i trained to do that at at a hospital in inglewood um about fifteen years ago 'cause my son is fifteen and he was a year old no sixteen he was a year old so um yeah and i've been um well it can be challenging in terms of hours it depends on how long the woman's in labor but uh and you know also like for me i always tell my friends and family if they want me to be their doula that i cannot guarantee a hundred percent i'm not doing it for business and that way and because of that i don't have like back up doulas that in case i'm sick or unavailable somebody else can fill in for me so um but so far it's been that all the women that've asked me i've been able to be there for some reason so the um the uh the only one that i missed was one a friend of mine from church she wanted me to go with her second baby i was with her for her first but the labor went so fast she didn't even call me [laughter]  it was in the middle of the night she was like  two hours of labor she wouldn't even if she had called me i wouldn't have been there in time [laughter] so um it went really fast but other than that you know um yeah i've been been been able to attend all the births of people that have asked me to do um in all of life or in your job uh probably my my own birth i mean my the birth of my own children um like there's an extreme sense of joy excitement relief because of course you're out of the pain and then like it's just it's just a matter of you know going forward from there but it's it's like something you can't explain it's it's just it's awesome after you give birth and i have experienced both ways i've done both um natural and my last child was via c_section so i've had both both um experiences um i with my third child i had kind of a crazy nurse she was a little psychotic but other than that we laugh about it now but when i was in labor it wasn't funny and um she she was not there when the doctor i mean it was my my third child was born very quickly after he broke the water and oof my husband was there but she was not nor was the doctor and she got in a lot of trouble because i only had like two contractions after that my daughter was born in the bed so for me it was great 'cause i didn't have to go through any of the labor but um i'm sure they weren't happy to fill out a lot of paper work after that so now would i give mysef for ten or twenty years ago um ten or twenty years ago i was probably more not as um relaxed not as um like i feel now at my age that um i i don't have the same concerns that i did then i don't worry about uh i don't worry at all about what people think about me i don't worry at all about what you know you know like my i noticed my daughter's oh mom you can't wear that because people are gonna say this i just say i don't care you know but they do because it's still in their frame of mind that that oh mom you have to dress like this and dress like that whatever so that would probably be it the wisdom that you you achieve with age that you you see how life there are so many things that are more important in life than worrying about little things what are you most proud of in your life most proud of um probably my family my my husband and my my children i mean the fact that we've stayed married that we've we're an in tact family that um my kids see every day how their friends suffer who come from divorced families or single parents and they um they actually express gratitude sometimes that we are married and we still you know we are still a family so i would say that's probably it um probably the one of my best qualities is uh being able to listen to people and being able to um not be judgmental um through the years i've had a  a lot of experience with um people with problems a lot of friends with problems people i know from church and it's just taught me that um everybody has weaknesses everybody has problems and um i don't think i'm better than someone else if you think you're better than someone else then that's usually um to me a sign that you don't know yourself well enough okay okay goodbye,0
sure  good chicago  it's cold in chicago  hmm oh i think in ninety nineteen eighty nine actually  oh very simple very easy  oh weather of course and i'm so easily located to san diego palm springs las vegas san francisco and things i like to do smog of course is bad  crime rate's higher than it should be um  and financial economic problems here  every year thanksgiving  very very much so we're a very big family  yes i do very much in fact i love flying on airplanes i love visiting new places i even like visiting different airports everyone's different  ooh let's see  i started off in pre-med haha i ended up in uh physics yes i am i teach <tea> i teach physics  and math and higher level math  well i enjoy working with kids  i enjoy teaching my mother was a teacher uh my dad was a truant officer and uh i've enjoyed it keeps you young  my dream job  my dream job would be to be a judge  yes in in the uh  youth court that would be fantastic but i should've thought of that sooner than now so i'm not gonna be able to do that  no <laughter> not at all  um i enjoy people being around people i'm very talkative at times uh  i like to do a lot of things and i'm very social when i do them  uh believe it or not i play bridge i play chess and i watch a good old old movie  ooh bad drivers  uh bad laws  politics often  when i'm annoyed  you know i really don't get annoyed that much i just let it go  it's not worth the pain and problems they could cause if i can't straighten out a problem let it go   go somewhere else  ooh always my bridge partner but that's different uh as far as anything else i don't really argue with people i i don't argue i don't like confrontation my parents of course very very much so um i had great parents  uh  my mother uh my parents met at tuskegee which is a black college and they always want me to go to a black college but of course i didn't wanna do that <laughter> uh i went to illinois so they're a very positive role model for me there's certain things that i don't do today because of them i don't drink i don't curse i don't look down on people who do but i don't have as much respect for people who do a lot of either one of those things um  i love to drive i love to travel and my dad used to always take us some place every weekend he was off we'd go somewhere 'cause we were in chicago indiana michigan some place in the area we'd go up to michigan and pick fruit or we got all our dogs from uh puppy farms in indiana that kinda thing uh i had an uncle who lived in uh wisconsin who was a dairy farmer so my dad used to love to drive and i love to drive also  mm that's a hard one  i've had a lot of great experiences uh i think the best one was uh we went for my anniversary we went to europe we went to paris and uh  we rode the orient express we went from we didn't go all the way to istanbul we went from london to venice and then flew back to paris uh    that was probably the best experience i've ever had in my life i i've never really cared for europe because there's so much here in the united stated to do and so much in america and i had been to alaska and hawaii but we said we'd do something different and we'd always wanted to go on the orient express and we did that expensive but phenomenal trip gotta do it once it's a once trip not once in a lifetime just once not traveling more sooner we did a lot when the kids were younger  but um there are a lot of things we should've probably done we didn't do i wish i had gone to chicago <chica> we would always go to chicago on thanksgiving but i think we should've gone more than just on thanksgiving my parents come here at around christmas time but i think we should've uh done a lot more when it comes to that  yes that's that's that's why it's a regret because it could've been avoided there's things we could've done and we were spending our time working and more concerned about getting ahead than actually family and what's closest to us     i think that people <peop> most people oh yes very definitely  ooh  that's a good question ten or twenty years ago  i would've said um don't take things too seriously but don't be too relaxed over 'em either sometimes you can uh take things for granted never take anything for granted  nothing's promised  oh heaven forbid  <laughter> no i have not <laughter> no no  no  very very easy i really have no problem with that once in awhile if i uh am anxious about something or have things coming up due or projects due then i get kind of uh anxious a little bit  i don't like to be late uh i don't like to make mistakes so therefore i i do have some anxiety issues which will cause me to stay up all night to get things done just to make sure that i have everything right  tired  i don't get irritable i think i just uh lethargic maybe a little <litt> just a just a little bit  very good i was up late last night so i'm kinda tired now but i i usually have no problems sleeping  uh and i get a good night's sleep  mhm no i have not  um no not at all i just came back off a christmas break <laughter> so i'm should be very relaxed now ooh i have great kids  i have a son at u_s_c and i have a son at u_c_l_a  and my daughter just got married  so i'm i'm proud of my i'm really proud of my kids  they're they're going to have a good life  oh yes um i enjoyed it i still enjoy it  being a parent is forever <laughter> so  uh <sigh> let's see  taking care of someone else and getting started off to have a good life   i think that that's rewarding making sure everything is covered  that needs to be covered with you kids whether it's their eating their sleeping their clothes they dress make sure they're content make sure they have no problems at school or home or uh that that they're safe physically mentally spiritually everything hmm my best friend would say she has not changed since high school <laughter> uh level-headed but uh great sense of humor relaxed i don't take things too seriously ooh i love the holidays i love christmas i love everything about it i love preparing the house for it i love baking cooking especially baking i love experimenting with new recipes and so the last couple of weeks because the holiday season was just here i felt fantastic everything is is quiet i'm not at work i'm not stressed out in any way at all i have no projects due that i have to think about anyway  so uh christmas time holiday time  really enjoyed recently well christmas of course we went to las vegas um the twenty seventh of december that was fantastic <fantas> we only stayed for two days we had a really good time uh we saw a great show  we had some great food we drove there we don't usually drive i don't like to drive a lot but we drove there and just took our time so it was good it was nice  okay  goodbye thanks for listening how's that one okay,0
yes pretty well from new york uh to go to college well to san diego to go to college and then later to l_a aerospace engineering um it was i was really good at math and science and i had a interest in airplanes no i'm a life coach uh to be a life coach and help people um i really really like uh how it feels to help other people and see them grow and know that i made a contribution to their life  um i like the weather it's it's great 'cause i really like to do outdoor things and i like uh doing things by the ocean traffic <laughter> and how crowded it is yeah um i like i live with my girlfriend and so i like it  uh we met on e harmony uh really close um my meditation teacher um yeah i i used to be very shy and self conscious and had a lot of anxiety and um i'd worry a lot about the future and uh i took classes in meditation and yoga classes and uh it really helped me to be more confident and more relaxed and just enjoy life a lot more  uh meditate and do yoga um let's see really mad um  i guess i don't know about mad i don't get mad that often but frustrated uh i would say like being stuck in traffic or um people that do mean things to other people for no real reason  um i usually if it's i usually talk to somebody about it if i can or if i can't then i'll usually do meditation or yoga and try and just let it go  uh pretty good at controlling my temper uh with my girlfriend and it was about um she was driving on the freeway and uh i suggested that she get over 'cause there was some road workers on the side and she like refused to do that and stayed in the the right lane so we argued a bit about that  uh it felt like she wasn't listening to me and almost like she was purposely not doing what i suggested to be defiant   um no um rollerblade kayak uh sing i sing in a choir  um a trip i took to india and nepal for six weeks yeah as much as i can <laughter> uh i really i love to explore i've i've loved to explore ever since i was a little kid and so i love you know seeing new things and discovering things about new cultures and i love backpacking in the wilderness and you know exploring nature  cool um well i went on a a trip to india and nepal it's my first time ever there um first week and a half i was with a big group of people and did a meditation and yoga retreat and went white water rafting on the ganga river and then um i went off on my own for the rest of the trip and went backpacking in nepal uh with a guide there and uh it was just really beautiful um in the anapurna area and then i went to uh back into india and explored um the area up near tibet and then uh went to uh rajasthan and to uh tiger park in madhya pradesh and was like really close to tigers um there i uh was contacted by a friend of mine and told that they were going on this this trip and i'd always wanted to go to india so i decided to do it  yeah it was it was really fun um caring and uh enthusatic for life no no no um pretty easy uh i don't sleep as well as i did when i was younger but for the most part i i sleep well once in a while i'll wake up you know at like four in the morning or five in the morning when i want to sleep 'till seven and not be able to get back to sleep but um in general it's pretty good uh i feel tired and not as motivated as usual and then sometimes wanna take a nap you know in the afternoon um no  um ten or twenty years ago um i guess to i i wish i would have invested money or bought like a house or something when i was younger um that would probably be the advice i would give myself   um i am empathetic with other people um positive and kind of have a positive outlook on life um very determined when i decide to do something uh i'll figure out how to do it even if it's challenging um i'm very creative in figuring out creative ways to do things i guess probably the strongest thing is that i'm pretty balanced i'm very organized but i'm also pretty creative so um pretty balanced that way  um pretty close uh much closer than i was when i was younger um and although i'd say i'm probably closer to friends and people that are in a spiritual community with me than i'm able to get to my family  uh being outdoors in nature and exercising and also singing um the fact that i've gone with followed my heart and did what i wanted to do versus gong with what i think i should do um i guess yesterday i was i spent the day by the beach and just uh bicycled and went skating and um visited some old friends there um felt very relaxed and uh invigurated and um uh i also felt like i miss living by the beach because i used to live really close to the beach  so i guess i was a little bit sad that i didn't live there anymore but uh really happy to be there goodbye,0

okay yes pretty good a little tired seattle washington uh when i was eighteen my mom and dad decided we wanted to move to california and uh so we moved down to pasadena uh actually monrovia first and i've been here ever since  yeah i did about two years ago i went up for work and a look around the area pretty easy actually i do adapt the warm weather not having rain nine months of the year um people mainly the uh the area how big it is the traffic when i first got here the smog that's better now no when i was younger i was but i got outta that with work i did sure when i became when i my mom died and i needed work i went for a job that was called petitioning and uh you have to go in front of stores and talk to people about signing petitions and you do that after awhile you don't get shy about talking to anybody also when i was in school i took public speaking and i learned that really liked it more than i thought i would so i so i did the census job i actually got up in front of groups of people and talked to them and showed them how to take the test and i enjoyed it right now i'm working on getting all my licenses for selling insurance um and i'm gonna start work uh trying to get money from people to uh help kids in the uh in the world well the on the uh job helping kids was also a paid job i needed a paid job the uh one for insurance was i was getting older and i needed work that was steady and that's something i can do till i'm eighty five or ninety or whatever  <laughter> to be an artist well i've been good with art i like drawing painting et cetera but i didn't know if i could ever make a living in it so i never really got into it and every time i tried it seemed i never got anywhere  so maybe when i get like eighty or ninety maybe i'll go into ceramics or something and do that as a profession no unfortuantely i don't that's okay i'm not my mom and dad are die are dead i have no brothers or sisters and the rest of my family have either moved away or i don't talk to them anymore or like that  well i have kind of an attitude that if i have me and friends i have then i'm okay uh read uh watch sports when they're available uh let's see i used to play golf i may do that again some day but not right now because of the cost and the time people that are rude well usually i ignore it this morning actually i told a guy to stop what he was doing and we got kind of an argument about it and then the argument was over and it was done   very good because i had a very bad temper when i was a kid and i told myself i had to control it uh this morning about the guy making lots and lots of noise uh on purpose and uh in a place that was just not the place to do it i mean it was a public place but uh and that was it just a little argument and i'm done with the argument once i say what i say <laughter> yes not right now that i can think of uh like read um if i can travel i travel uh i don't travel long distances but even going out to riverside is kind of an adventure for me seeing things on the way and back talking to people maybe well a number of years ago i went drove back east to uh massachusetts to do work back there on the way back i took a greyhound bus all the way back from washington d_c all the way back to california   uh into washington first and then down from there and uh worked in massachusettes for about oh uh six months to eight months  enjoyed the area quite a bit but didn't want to be there when the snow came and uh enjoyed coming back on the bus had people near next to me almost all the way different people and had a lot of fun yeah yeah i was in the airforce and uh when i was eighteen nineteen sixty five during the vietnam war no i was in great falls montana it it really didn't years later i probably uh learned more from the fact that i got out early and maybe i should have stayed in and stuck with it but i tended to quit things when i was younger and so now that and other things i decided never to quit anything i came down here uh played pool for a number of years uh finally graduated from high school which i had dropped out of when i moved uh went on to college got my bachelor's degree and an a_a degree at pasadena and cal state l_a and started working various jobs and uh that's about it took care of my mom uh business that was my major i also studied cyclic anthropology and philosphy and history et cetera no no never depressed <de> lately not so good between the fact that i sleep in my car and it's very cold and then sometimes i do get uh and with all the things going on in my life right now i i think of things and so and plus i get up at four thirty in the morning   that's okay uh tired and i get a little grumpy sometimes but not very much tired with all the things i've had to do and uh weather and sleep no uh a little bit sometimes about how maybe i should've started doing all this years ago i just go on i tell myself to basically stop it and to uh go on doing what things to uh improve myself not very anymore it took me years to study that to do that i don't know if you call it zen or not but uh couple months ago when i passed all my tests and uh medicare <medi> uh medicare advantage and passed everyone of 'em for every company that sent 'em to me i stick to everything i do now i'm persistent  i don't let things get out of hand before i do something about it i used to be uh what's the word i put off things i don't do that anymore and uh i treat people nicely always until given a reason not to and i don't talk about my bad stuff to anybody usually <laughter> not very because the same thing i've trained myself over the years to not talk about myself i talk to other people i talk about them uh let's see my mother gandy um bertrand russell let's see i'm not sure who else other people i've had but i don't remember their names or they were teachers et cetera earlier in life uh like i said uh stopping everything not completing things i regret very much uh yeah i coulda done better probably the advice i gave myself to get off my butt and go learn and get an education uh and get on with my life do something  that i've survived well i'm sixty five i've been sleeping in my car for a number of years i went from sleeping on pavement to where i got a car  while i've done that i've improved my credit rating i've gotten uh a number of jobs that i've been very happy with  i've had a lot of friends both homeless <ho> people that are homeless and not homeless and uh i'm in pretty good health and where as other people in my family have died young so i guess that's about it uh good jokes uh people having a happy time going and having a drink with somebody on occasional basis uh about eight months ago was the last time when i had a beer with someone let's see probably uh getting within one foot of a live wild deer it was in uh green lake in washington and i uh was out behind our house and this wild buck deer was walking in the field and i started motioning to it and it came within about one foot of me and the only reason it left my dad drove down the drive way and it made noise and the deer ran off i was within petting difference distance of him and i wasn't to sure if should've petted him or not but i was about to <laughter> as you bye,0
yeah i'm doing okay how are you doing i'm originally from like a suburb <su> a suburb of l_a from the san gabriel valley i like the diversity i like the vibe of the city i've lived other places and it's just not as happy here i feel like i can really thrive here so i just like l_a like all the things that are so close together then there's a lot of interesting things that totally different parts of the city just miles away from each other uh don't like the traffic don't like all the cars but i can live with it i mean there's not that much i don't like i studied music um vocal performance i studied music technology things like that yes right now um i sing in an opera company but my i do have a day job because it doesn't pay that much unless you're actually working for the l_a opera so i do have a day job i work at a call center that caters mostly to performers and actors and things like that and it's really good because if i get a call i can call in and change my shift very easily so it's actually a pretty good gig and i do some uh technology gigs sometimes you know it's do some recording some live sound stuff but i'm kinda wanna get away from that do some video work sometimes but again i wanna get away from that i wanna go back to the  because i find that performing more is more interesting i like being talent more than i like being crew <laughter> so i kinda wanna get away from that side and start working more toward actually doing what i wanna do with my life sometimes i mean per my personal life yeah so i do have a shell that i put out there to deal with people but if i'm at home you know i'd kinda rather just keep to myself or my husband or my cats or whatever talk to family   don't really have too many close friends <clears throat> but yeah you know i'd rather keep to myself uh moderately close to the family that i have left i've actually lost a lot of family in the last ten years or so but like thank you <laughter> but like uh my i'm close to my husband and you know i've got couple of cousins i talk to and my aunt that i have an aunt that i talk to a bit but it's not like we're interacting every day close together  but it's somewhat close mostly i sing or i read or i write or just hang out and try to clear my mind of all thoughts sometimes it doesn't work but i try to do that and try to just clear everything and see what starts coming back in and sometimes <ss> sometimes that works sometimes it doesn't but mostly creating things um contacting my family some <so> you know through facebook or whatever works but mostly in my free time i create things i'd like to travel more i like to travel by car a lot um i mean my idea of like having a birthday celebration would be to go on a road trip and i like to travel more um i would love to travel for work things or whatever but i don't get as much of an opportunity as i would like to to travel seeing <see> uh particularly traveling by car seeing like the landscape change seeing people change seeing you know feeling the vibrations of the area change  i like just seeing what's out there seeing and i know that there's a bigger world outside of  where i am and where i live and my world and i like to see that but i like to leave that too and go back to my own world <laughter> <laughter> <clears throat> um let's see xxx a trip that i like to take is to make the drive from here to nevada whether i go all the way to vegas or just go to state line um my cousin and i would take what we call exit one trips because once you get to the first exit of a highway you're either in another state or you're at the end of the highway so we'd take those we'd just   sort of impromptu with like <li> a day or two notice just move things around just take off so those are actually trips that i i like making <mak> 'cause i take off and then just come back sometimes the same day sometimes overnight just small short trips that aren't very involved but you just get to go and you see things and see how um you know the desert landscape looks in different seasons how people react in different times of the year in different areas  so close to home but not but not close to home close to home but uh still a world away so that 'cause i don't really have time to take like a two week vacation or whatever but that's just little things that kinda put things back in perspective and and clear my head and things like that i mean 'cause there's sort of a sense of meditation and zen that you get on a highway that you don't get driving a freeway so i i like i like doing that the last time that happened was may of last year that's the last time i was able to do that we actually my aunt came over with my cousin who's ten years younger than i am and we kinda grew up like sisters and i was about to move away from the inland empire which is where they live so they kinda took me on a last hurrah and we drove up to vegas and looked around and came back 'cause i actually lived in vegas for awhile but i didn't like it so they kinda i showed <show> showed them some of the locals sites around there and we came back and was you know an overnight trip but we were driving the entire time <laughter> so it was kind of an interesting uh things that are just inherently unfair when people are mean to the elderly or to children or to animals people who can't fight back and they're mean to them just because they can't fight back   and i actually like to see people who are strong <st> as strong as the people who are being mean standing up and being an advocate or what have you so i think that's one thing that's makes me really mad just being cruel or mean for no reason you know not people <pe> for people who can't fight back or for people who've done nothing to deserve it just that kinda really just makes me mad when i'm annoyed i'll try to just walk away from the situation and if the situation insists on following me then i'll wind up lashing out somehow either   you know verbally just cutting 'em with a quip or you know i mean i i rarely just i rarely will yell at somebody but i'll try to you know if i'll try to walk away and defuse it if that doesn't work then i'll let them know that they're annoying me and get away from me <laughter> that usually works  not in like legal trouble or anything because usually i'll find a way to get them to leave me alone um so there's not really like big trouble but 'cause i think 'cause it's it it is off-putting and it's not expected <exp> the expected reaction and that's actually kind of cultivated in me that it's not the expected reaction 'cause i know that will work and get people away from me so it's not really in trouble and if  it's is trouble it's usually trouble that it's from their the other person's perspective and it doesn't affect me at all because it's usually a situation i can get out of  so as long as they leave me alone you know i don't i i'll walk away from it uh the last time i argued with somebody like person <per> like a person <per> like a family member or an outsider or somebody not in my uh the last thing i can think of was i argued with my husband about the care of my mother-in-law 'cause she's got dementia and so we one of the reasons we came out here from the inland empire was to take care of her 'cause she won't go anywhere but l_a i mean she is like hardcore angelino like you know we we know we are the we're that in our nature but we also know it's cheaper to live elsewhere <laughter> but um so we came out here to take care of her  and he wants her to be able to stay in her in her apartment and i want her to move in with us because it would be cheaper and faster and easier and safer for her if she lived with us but she wants to stay where she is 'cause she can't see that there's inherent danger now because of the disease process  but he wants her to stay where she he wants her to be able to have what she wants 'cause he's a mama's boy like i am i'm a mama's girl even though i've lost my mom like four years ago i'm still a mama's girl and i'll still <st> and i still and i know that it brings you a sense of satisfaction to to carry out their wishes because you care about them so much and that's what they want so you wanna get it for 'em and because you know they you know that happened when you were growing up when they tried to give you what you want because you wanted it  and you wanna do that for them now like sort of giving back to them somebody that you care about somebody you feel deserves it but it's kinda dangerous for her you know and i don't want things <thi> something to happen to her yet i want her to remain who she is for as long as she can 'cause i know it the disease that she has is gonna erase who she is eventually and eventually she will have to be put in a place where they can give her twenty four hour medically trained care but until then we can we can handle it you know amongst ourselves 'cause it's not that bad but it's getting where she really shouldn't <shou> has no business living by herself anymore so the solution right now is he stays there most the time with her and i go back to our house and i it gets stressful and it gets annoying because i do i handle the outside things i run the errands i take her to the store things like that he does the day to day things makes sure she has <ha> she eats makes sure she you know has clean clothes things like that so i mean it's a partnership it's a it's a dual effort it's very much a dual effort but i would like her to move in with us so that was that's like a source of it's not really like yelling screaming argument but lively discussion <laughter> you know than debate meh it's not insurmountable i mean life's not gonna be easy ever and if it is that's when you should worry because that's when somebody can pull the rug out from under you so as long as you're on top of things and you're present in your life it's not gonna be easy but you deal with it and you you move on uh the most positive influence i think have been probably my mother and my grandmother 'cause my mom was pretty much a single mom and my grandmother helped raise me and they actually gave me a lot of confidence and but were realistic about it so i mean i think i have sort of a realistic sort of a downer temperment <laughter> to myself but they but they helped me see that it's just in me and it's not something i can't get over and that you know life's gonna go on you know my mom would say to me when you're forty you're forty whether you're working at mcdonald's or doing what you want with your life and i think that was a big influence on how i lived have how i've lived my life since she's passed   i regret not taking care of myself in the last year of my mother's life because i think it may have clouded some of my decisions now i do have underlying conditions and everybody in my family is diabetic and i didn't take care of that when she was the last year of her life 'cause i was too busy wanting to get her home my focus was to get her home so i didn't eat right i didn't take my insulin right um i wound up making myself insulin resistant that that year just 'cause my blood sugar was so high for eh like a year eating just horrible foods when i did eat so it really took a toll and i really actually made myself very sick  and i'm wondering well if i didn't if i would've taken care of myself and i had my head on completely straight and my my vision <vi> my vision and my thoughts weren't completely <complete> weren't clouded would i have made some better decisions on her behalf especially when she needed 'em and when she needed me to be to step in and make the decisions for her because she  uh wound up having a health catastrophe 'cause she had kidney well she had kidney damage that wound up being kidney failure and her health insurance provider missed that so she wound up having sort of this whole catastrophe where everything at once just started breaking down she wound up having a stroke at like fifty one she had had a small stroke and it just kinda went down from there so i'm thinking well if i didn't if i had taken care of better care of myself would i have been able to take better care of her and i know there wasn't anything i would've been able to do to prevent her death but what if i if i would i have been be able to make it easier on her if i would have taken care of myself and that's like one huge regret that i have oh i know i am <laughter> but xxx it's my desire to take responsibility for everyone and everything that i care about taking responsibility for my own life and me and mine and i know other people i can't really direct them into my own vision because they're their own individual beings and they can't you know be what i want them to be and i know they're not going to be but i still have you know my ideals and i want the way i want everything to go and i want everybody that i care about to be happy and to be able too  fit into my life in a way in the best way possible but i know 'cause they're other beings and i know i'm not gonna be able to do that for them and they're not gonna be able to do that for me but it's still my ideals <laughter> so i have to sometimes have to look at it and go well is this what i want because i want it or what is what they want and what's their <thei> is it their decision or mine and it's usually it's theirs and i know it's theirs so i so if you really care about somebody you're just gonna support them and go with them but  it's still kinda hard <laughter> for for me and know i gotta get over it um ten or twenty years ago probably to have been more assertive in starting my own life because i wound taking care of my mother i mean she got sick literally the weekend i graduated from college <laughter> and i had a job lined up and i had to pull out of that because she needed me to take care of her and i think i would've been more aggressive about starting my own life getting a job outside  the house in addition to caring for her getting uh my own job history my own credit history thing like things like that built up instead of becoming just totally her daughter for about ten years so i think i i probably would've done that um but i tell myself just do that you keep who you are and learn to separate your you who you are and what you feel you need to be doing for your family to keep a sense of of yourself that's probably what i would've and do things for yourself to keep that sense of yourself that's probably the advance advice of what i would give myself    ten years ago <laughter> no no no but probably 'cause i haven't gone to a doctor about it <laughter> 'cause i don't wanna know and i mean it's not i know there've been times in my life where i've been severely depressed and it's usually circumstances and had to pull myself out of it but i'd rather pull myself out of it before resorting to treatment and of it gets <ge> um after my mother had died i mean it'd been this long battle for a year that we lost and i didn't know if i if i was to blame for that it's like logically i knew i wasn't but how could i convince myself of that um two weeks after she died i wound up with pulmonary embolisms in one in each lung because i didn't take care of myself for a year and i figured oh i'm thirty years old if you know whatever i do to myself i can get over no <laughter> turns out no <laughter> but um i mean i wound up having to take more medication because of that uh it's been a fight to get my own health back to get to be able to get out of that depression 'cause so much of my life was based on being my mother's daughter all of a sudden i didn't it's like the rug was pulled out my like bottom fell out of my world after that so that was the prilly pretty much sent me into a deep depression um i almost got divorced because of it because i just didn't want anything anymore  so and i was i being really distant from my husband by then at that time we were married for about two years at that point and i started getting very distant from him just pushing everything away just you know figuring well what am i gonna do with the rest of my life now and it it's been a fight you know you mean there times when no i couldn't get up just stay in bed and sleep all day you know but then realizing that when my mother died i had four cats to look after two are mine two are hers and so i wound up adopting the two that were hers i mean well they don't have a choice of whether they can go out and get their own food and get their own you know own own supplies i took that responsibility of doing it for them so that was one motivating factor was that they didn't have a choice of whether or not i was gonna get up and provide for them i mean i could go without eating i could go without taking care of myself but they couldn't they didn't you know so they eh they actually got me up and and made me go out and face things even though i didn't want to didn't just didn't just kinda wanted to curl up and die but that would've been my choice not theirs and they i mean what would happen to them if i wasn't there to take care of them they would've been you know sent to a shelter or whatever probably  and maybe they would've not been readopt me home and adopted by somebody else maybe they would have been killed for  for me i mean for me making selfish decisions   so it's like i need somebody to take care of to get myself out of bed <laughter> so <s> and that's actually been a motivating factor is to to 'cause i've figured out that if it was just me i'd be able to live without a lot of stuff i mean i would be able to live in my car if i wanted it wouldn't be a big deal i wouldn't care   as long as i was doing what i wanted with my life but i have a family to look after now  so i have to go out and do things  you know i i have to go out and look for legitimate work you know day you know day job i have to you know   but i'm trying to strike a balance between the two because it's what i wanna do with my life but yet i have to take care of my family so i'm   been working on on a balance of the two very <laughter> but it's worth it i mean  it would be very i'd have a lot less things to worry about if i just lived in my car and said forget it <laughter>  but keeping a residence down paying bills things like that  it's it's difficult but you have to do it you know if you want you want anything <anyth> if you ever want anything in your life you have to go through that  and i and and i know that  but  it it gets hard sometimes you do wanna give up  but then  it's like well what's the alternative  i mean i don't think i could live a comfortable life  'cause if i did i wouldn't do anything <laughter> i have to be slightly uncomfortable or i'm not gonna do anything with myself i'm just gonna  be content to just hang out all day stay in bed hang out with my cats or whatever  and i wouldn't get anything done  uh very  anxious and nervous and i mean what if  i don't find  enough you know enough work to be able to pay my rent or whatever what if um  you know what what if i can't   keep a semblance of stability in my life and it it's actually hard work to be stable <laughter> and i know it's hard work to be stable but  what you know it's just eh a lot of what ifs  and and i don't think it's things that haven't happened and it's stupid and pointless to worry about things that haven't happened and i know that  but it still happens <ha> it still creeps in  so that's actually  a source of  anxiety  but then you try to let the anxiety go by getting things done figuring things out making a solid plan and going for it  but i i i know it it's a cycle and i'll go from being really anxious and oh my god what am i gonna do what am i gonna do to saying okay what is the fundamental thing i need to take of here  i mean what <wha> what is just extraneous and what can <c> what can what is what are the actual non issues and what is the actual issue  and so  figure out how to figure things out that way and then the anxiety starts to go away a little bit but then something'll pop up and the what ifs will come up again  mm i'll have to  uh  figure it out again <laughter> but i know it's a cycle i know um what seems huge on the surface when you start chipping away at it   you get over it pretty quickly you get through it  the last time i felt really happy i don't know zz um i  huh <laughter> that's a good question that actually <ac> that actually surprisingly stumped me  because i do feel happy sometimes sometimes not so much sometimes just kinda eh in the middle um really like overjoyously happy i don't know  i i'm not i can't think of <o> of when that happened i don't know you don't know  perceptions of other people i mean  probably as somebody who  oddly enough somebody who is laid back and you know  handles things as they come but i don't see myself as that   at all and it's a it probably that i can think on my feet and i'm not afraid to  hussle my butt off and do whatever i have to to survive and get things done  um that  and i can do it creatively and i try to  strive for balance  probably  probably the best things about me <laughter>  that i'm doing basically what i want with my life which even though it's not all easy it's not  um you know i'm not financially well off or anything it's still a lot more than a lot of people can say about their lives 'cause i have an aunt that i really don't talk to  who and the reason why i don't talk to her is because she's always miserable i mean she's got a career that she  it's more of a job that she fell into  'cause my older aunt uh loves animals but didn't wanna be a veterinarian so she became a dog groomer  and she was actually really good at it she had a stable business for a long time   but her hands <ha> you know she started getting arthritis in her hands and she had um the actually my cousin's father went and kinda stole all the money from her business so she lost her business   and she kinda she retired early 'cause between that and the arthritis she wound up retiring early  she employed my younger aunt who was still a dog groomer but she hates it   and it's like change your life if you hate your life so much change it  and the thing <thi> the thing i'm most proud of is  yeah i'm not as financially well off as she is but i'm doing what i want with my life you know i can  be creative i can have creative people around me people who i actually like to talk to around me  people i actually like in my life and  be happy with that  and i see a lot of people who aren't  and it it gives me a sense of of maybe a a bloated sense of self satisfaction to be able to say i'm not like that  and i'm actually doing what i want even though there's sacrifices i'm still fundamentally doing what i want with my life now thank you <laughter> okay  thank you <laughter> goodbye,1
yeah  so so <sigh> nebraska  uh work i've been coming here off and on for years but officially moved here couple years ago  um  some good days some bad days i i guess i've gotten as used to it as i'm gonna be i don't know if that makes sense but  um <sigh> accessibility to to different things um as compared to nebraska um you know more opportunities to do different things and and explore different things  areas of interest uh the crime um  attitude <laughter> um  uh lack of lack of uh  uh work ethic lack of uh  kindness in people um cut-throat  yeah  i used to quite a bit  uh sense of freedom  the uh the adventure  um okay  you want me to tell you about a trip <laughter> uh egypt  i  yeah  uh i went with my mother and some family friends we went on an eight day cruise down the nile saw all the uh pyramids in giza um just it was just a incredible adventure just to get away from everything and everybody and and uh close friends and just have a great time  yeah  um not really at all  um just uh uh have history of um abuse and and neglect and uh just not a real functional family dysfunctional is is definitely a keyword in our family so  thank you um no not really i'm talked about it a lot before um so  i'm okay with it  <sigh> um <sigh> <laughter> it's really hard to say i haven't had very good uh uh very positive role models um um  ask me the question again  <sigh> well maybe at best my mother  but uh she's a she's also been a negative uh aspect of my life but um  uh yeah i guess i can't really identify anybody who's been a real real positive influence in my life  um the the trips that i've been on  um i used to  work out i used to do yoga i used to um  i used to meditate i used to exercise and i used to um i used to do a lot of things lately um i find it uh hard to relax i don't have the same uh  the same outlets that i did before the same uh i <ss> i i don't pursue them as much anymore i guess i'm i've lost my motivation or something i'm depressed about it you know i guess there it is right there  um pretty good i i is temper as far as getting to the point of uh uh physicality i don't ever that um  uh but i stand my ground and um but i can control my temper i i i never lose control really   um <sigh> the last time  uh probably  um as recently as you know  in the last month or so i maybe argued with um  uh an acquaintance over um  uh <laughter> uh i don't know i i have to come back to that question  no no yes um  well officially october of last year but i've i think i've been depressed longer than that but officially october of last year  um  actually i was uh being treated for other medical issues and um my depression was notable to the doctors so yeah  yeah  um  well i've never been suicidal but just to just to just in i i just often have thought um  eh that i don't have much reason to to live i used to think i had a purpose and such but um i don't really have anybody in my life um  who i think cares enough about me uh  that i really <rea> if i was even dead uh so um i've kind of lost myself  and um i used to that used to be enough  that i was um enough to uh  you know to to have purpuse in my life but um  i've lost quite a bit of that  motivation <motiv> yeah  well i'm trying to pull it together i'm trying to um  <sigh> get back a sense of me  i get inspired every once in awhile but um overall i just don't seem to be making much progress  yeah  i wouldn't really call it therapy i don't have a therapist per se i have a a nurse practitioner who prescribes medication for me and nobody really to talk about psychosocial issues  um i uh huh  did you say that sucks eh  okay  and uh yeah  um overwhelmed preoccupied um  just uh trying to stay alive stay on top of things  no uh  easy when i can i don't um  yeah when i if i get a chance to fall asleep i don't have any problem with it  um even more distracted and uh um  um even more  uh lackluster i guess is the word  whatever uh if i had a best friend um <sigh> i don't know um <sigh> he maybe lot of positive adjectives before but now just you know just uh some people say i should be proud 'cause i'm surviving a hard time or some people think that uh  i'm a a loser  <laughter> so um i don't know <sigh> maybe um  a survivor uh persistent um um well i used to be proud of my career and um  kinda giving back to people giving back to society um 'cause i was given  a lot it felt like um <sigh> so i'm just proud to uh  i don't have much of a sense of pride anymore to be quite honest i i've um it uh i don't know <sigh> <laughter> psychology and um  well initially yeah  um no not really per se although my current career involves a lot of uh  psychology a lot of um  uh the aspects i don't know what i'm trying to say um  it's a part <p> it's a part of it but it's not the center of it  um well i guess if my career is still going i'm in uh nursing but um i've been sick lately and with depression and other healthcare problems i  uh have uh found it necessary to apply for disability social security income  and i'm starting the process of that 'cause i'm not working   very <sigh> educating people um making a difference i mean i used to i had i've had my dream jobs i've had my dream jobs i don't uh  i don't know what the future will hold for for uh work but um  something i suppose working with people again health uh helping in some way  um no but lately with the depression more so at times i used to say that i never regretted anything 'cause i would make the best decision of all things in front of me but um  i just wish there were times then that um  the choices that i would have were  <laughter> were better 'cause some choices that i seem to have made or were made for me have um made my world kind of shitty   for lack of a better word shitty  what i don't understand  <sigh>  to be strong to um believe in myself  to remember that i've survived a lot of things and i will survive this too   to get up off my ass and move to um <sigh> to have confidence faith  um <sigh> i just murphy's law has kicked my ass   so much you know i just uh  it it seems like when i've tried to make my world better i just keep getting knocked down um so it it's almost like i'm i don't wanna give up but um every time i try and move forward i get knocked back and it gets gets exhausting  and i don't have any support system really nobody not really  <sigh> um  loyal um hardworking  um  dependable  um  uh capable um well at least i used to be uh  intelligent  comtemplative um eh uh deep not a superficial person um  yeah i guess those are some of them  many years ago  um i used to have a lot of confidence i used to be pretty dynamic person i used to be people would <wou> say <s> used to say that i was the most centered person that they knew and i used to help people and i'm now in their shoes and i don't seem to be able to help myself  <sigh>  <sigh>  i can't think of anything right now <laughter> i can't think of really anything right now  i don't do

that twelve hundred dollars was liquidated it went it went 'cause i was just stupid and got greedy       but that's when i'm happiest probably go to a casino and and win or just stay even and not lose

<ke> keep your money you know try to find some other means of excitement <ex> of excitement but      but for me being at that blackjack table with big wages was was my reality that reality was better than being outside the casino my reality was right there at the now texas hold 'em i did okay you know with that you know you'd i didn't lose much i'm a pretty good player to that blackjack       ugh

movie premiere at the grauman's you know you know it's free and i get you get the popcorn and soda and you see the stars that's about as exciting as it's gonna get right now okay  alright take care  bye,1
yes i'm doing great how about you i'm born in the u_s i was born in uh orlando florida um my parents my dad had a lot of friends in los angeles so uh we decided to move here um it was pretty different i mean uh the place i was before was very it was a very small town um you probably won't even notice it um on the map um so it was a big learning experience um 'cause you know the schools were a lot larger and  different cultures and ethnicities um so it was a unique experience um last time i've been back was probably about five years ago um definitely different uh my aunt she lives in uh again she lives in a small town um so if you wanna go to a movie theater you have to drive out at least an hour or if you wanna go to a mall it's a it's an hour drive so um it's complete opposite of los angeles um the convenience everything uh everything i could possibly want is here um the weather is great um shopping um multiple <mult> a lot of lot of friends here sports um l_a is just kind of like the perfect area you know  you know i wanna live here kind of for the rest of my life actually  um the big thing would probably be traffic i mean wherever you go there's gonna be traffic whether you're on the four o five or the one o one it's it's just traffic it it you know it can kill like two hours in your day which is huge  um yeah quite a bit for personal and for uh for business i travel um you know usually overseas or um domestically um i travel so and i enjoy it a lot um seeing different places uh different areas meeting new people um eating different kinds of food um being able to sightsee and tour um if i have a day or two free um it's just experiencing um having new experiences just enriches my life um computers  um and i also did english as well yes i am um i work in i_t in an i_t department at a semiconductor company dream job um probably working for apple <laughter> um since i pretty much own everything they have uh yeah it'd be great to work for apple um you know it depends um there are times when it's good to be alone but for the most part i consider myself uh an outgoing social person  um nothing too much i guess uh if you kind of uh make a promise and you and you break it several times and i might get a little bit might get a bit a little bit uh annoyed but i don't think i would get really mad um good question i'd probably say um i tend to eat a little bit more um just kinda keep my mind off of it a little bit um but usually doesn't last that long so i just keep kinda like tend <te> i tend to eat out a little bit more more of kinda like maybe junk food or something um i think i'm pretty good i i rarely get mad um and if i do it doesn't really last that long um so i think i'm pretty good at um i guess controlling my temper um again i really don't get angry so um it's not really an issue for me um i'd say during the elections um we were talking about uh president obama and mitt romney and you know who'd be the best fit uh for for the next presidency um  that kind of got a little bit uh i guess a little bit heated but it was more for uh i guess more for fun sake than anything else but it was an interesting conversation  um like to eat out a lot uh watch movies uh play video games um just go out shop uh play sports uh watch a laker game if i can in person it would probably be the best um bowling photography um like to doing a lot i like to do a lot of different things um and of course electronics    um i'd say outgoing loyal um intelligent funny um and a great listener uh no i have not no no um for most nights it's it's pretty easy um just have to avoid drinking coffee or tea before i sleep um other than that it's been pretty easy um i'd say a little bit sluggish tired um kind of reaction time is a little bit slower um aside from that um i think nothing too much <mu> like too glaring or anything um the usual just being sluggish and not moving as quickly as i should um pretty good have no complaints no pretty much the same um i guess today i had my uh car maintenance today and it didn't cost me anything so that's great and i thought it was gonna cost me you know something extra on the side but you know the uh the service advisor waived it so i got everything free today so actually i'm in a really good mood  hmm no nothing uh probably um don't spend as much save more money um aside from that um nothing else just be um kind of more um wise with your money um i'd probably say my best friend he's kind of a you know helped me out and i helped him out as well so it's been uh kind of a great learning experience um you know developing our uh our friendship and he's bailed me out a couple of times i bailed him out as well so it's kind of it's a mutual thing we do um you know with each other um and it's you know it's like a great way to bond as well  hmm um i'd say probably going back uh back to korea um to visit my uh relatives um you know they they're a lot more different than uh i remember you know like fifteen years ago when i was a kid i was actually kind of afraid of some of them but um now that i see them you know recently they've actually mellowed a lot and they're actually  pretty fun to talk to so um it was kind of a a learning experience for me because uh they're you know they did complete one eighty from when i was a when i was a kid um i say um guess work would be part of it um  buying my uh the car that i wanted it took a couple years to save up to buy the car but i i paid it all off so i don't have any more car payments so that's great too and you know being able to help my uh family out as well  hmm um  let's see a while recently <recen> um a couple weeks ago i went to uh las vegas for the uh for c_s um which is great if you into gadgets and electronics um you get to see all the uh the goodies coming out this year so that was uh pretty interesting to see and um some things that uh you know when you read on blogs they didn't talk about so you get to see it actually in person kind of experience it from a user standpoint so i thought it was great  um and it's just fun it's kind of like being a kid in a candy store you get to play with different gadgets um so it was really fun for me  yeah,0
<synch> sure i'm doing alright new jersey yes three months ago not very often uh it's much different uh i don't know it's just <laughter> it's a lot more crowded here to start a new life for myself it wasn't very easy at all <sigh> uh it was uh it was quite rough at first but you know i'm still trying to get used to life here i've met some good friends here um you know i love the hollywood area um and just you know the mountains are beautiful that's kinda things i love hmm the traffic not really no i don't just haven't had the time or the finances to digital media well i've always loved you know <deep breath> computers and you know designing things and uh i don't know i just kinda fell into it no i dropped out well i i guess my dream job would be working <deep breath> in something that uh i went to school for you know i i never really completed my education um but i guess it'd be great if i went you know back to school and you know finished you know my degree in digital media and uh you know finished and uh started working you know doing something in that field a little bit of both you know i i can be shy at times but i like to push myself to be outgoing you know it's kind of a a struggle for me but i i don't wanna be you know in a shell so i kinda force myself to be outgoing listen to music i uh sometimes just drive and um you know play music in my car and that helps me relax or i smoke a cigarette oh like what ooh um <laughter> just heavy metal that's all i listen to is metal well <sigh> it depends on how high my stress level is and how angry i am but i i do my best to not get so pissed off <laughter> scrubbed_entry and i don't know she um she wanted me to to come and pick her up uh she was a little drunk and uh we just kinda fought over the phone all over some other things and i just ended not picking her up because of her attitude on the phone with me <laughter> yeah it does something i feel guilty about is uh not talking to my kids uh often or as often as i should i've just been so busy with trying to get myself all situated here that i i don't really have time to you know talk to my kids as much as i'd like to you have no idea um it's it comes natural but it's no way easy and uh it's it's the hardest job that i love to do but right now it's extremely difficult for me because they live so far away and i i made this choice to come out here to l_a and i feel bad that i don't see them you know but the reason i came out here was to better myself so i can provide for them fear you know fear <f> just fear will you know you <y> you fear what's gonna happen to your kids you fear that something awful is gonna happen and not seeing them it brings about that fear a lot more you know and i can't i can't always be there with them i can't see them you know it it wasn't as bad when i was living in florida um and i i at least i used to see them it wasn't very often but i used to used to see them now i don't see them at all and that's the that's the hardest thing i've had to do as a parent is to step away from my kids if only temporarily i don't know how long i'm gonna be here for i don't know what my future holds but the hardest thing is being so far away from them just the the joy that they bring to me i mean i could be having a bad day and they just cheer me right up i mean i eh it sucks being away from them for for so long and they're so far away and just not seeing their faces that's it's it's the worst thing ever you know but i i love to just see their faces they they just bring a smile to my face and um i don't know well um i think the fact that i can get down to their level um i'm i'm a bit goofier <laughter> as a father than my dad was with me my dad was you know strict all the time sure he used to you know laugh and play with us but you know he was always very reserved you know and he kinda held back a lot he a lot of his emotions just because you know he was a he was a strong very tough guy um but with me i i i'm very goofy and silly with my kids and i'm strict when i have to be but i always love to you know play around with them as much as possible you know not i don't want them to grow up too fast and that that may have been yeah well <sigh> a situation that i wish i would've handled differently there's so many <laughter> uh i guess when i was still with my ex-wife in florida i wish i wouldn't have gotten so angry or i wish i wouldn't have let her get the best of my emotions she had a tendency to get underneath my skin and uh you know keep picking at me until i exploded and i allowed her to do that you know i i should've just walked away when i could and um you know not let my temper get the best of me no no no uh sometimes it's hard um sometimes i just lay awake in bed <sigh> you know thinking all the things that are going through my head all the you know all the stress that i'm going through with work and you know making sure you know wondering if i'm gonna if i'm gonna be able to make you know rent you know wondering what my kids are going through you know when i'll see them again if they even care about me anymore if they even know they have a father you know those are some of the things that run through my head and and that keeps me up at night sometimes a little <sigh> but <sigh> you know i put myself in this situation so you know i i gotta bear with it you know i gotta you know you reap what you sow so i <sigh> i gotta deal with it in my own way lately um i've been trying to not think so much about you know all that's going into my life uh i try to distract myself and that kind of gets me in a better mood you know if i'm hanging out with friends or just watch a little t_v something to get my mind off you know all the stresses in my life um the last time i felt really happy uh was actually a couple of nights ago i went out drinking with um with a couple of my friends from work and um i don't know we just got pretty drunk and just <laughter> that kinda helped me to forget all the crap that was previously going through my head so if if i can distract myself if i can forget about all that other stuff then i'm happy <sigh> some of my best qualities i guess that i'm convincing <laughter> um uh i'm kind of like a i guess you would say a counselor to some people you know some of my close friends you know i may talk people into doing things that they may regret or i may i mean i'm sorry take talk people out of things that they you know may end up regretting or i may um you know just listen to people so you know eh i could say that you know i definitely you know listen to my friends and help them out in their time of need when they're going through something troubling times like like i'm going through scrubbed_entry uh who lives in florida you know i talk to him every now and then and he's been having troubles with his girlfriend and you know i just kind of talk to him about his problems and listen i mostly <mo> i mainly listen because you know i don't think he has anybody else to listen to you know when i was living in florida i was uh very close with him so you know he he'd always relied on me and now that i'm here in l_a i don't wanna lose that you know connection with him because i mean i've always been there for him so he um he relies on me to listen to his problems and give him some advice you know about what i think you know he should do um so i think <th> i think he appreciates that and i and i'm glad that he you know relies on me for that uh he trusts me enough to tell me all that stuff <laughter> i don't know <sigh> um sometimes i wish i wasn't so kind or generous it seems bad but sometimes i i don't know people may take advantage of me and i may not realize it and um i don't like saying no to people i like to always please people so if i can change that maybe i wish i wasn't such a people pleaser sometimes financially in trouble <laughter> <deep breath> sometimes i you know it you know help others and not you know that may make me broke sometimes yeah i may not have enough to pay bills but i feel better helping people i don't know i regret not breaking up with my ex-wife sooner i regret <re> i regret <re> because she put me through so much crap in my life and um i was always trying to be a people pleaser i was trying to please her you know trying to please my kids as much as i can by not breaking up you know the family but you know there's only so much one person can take and i i think probably if i would've left sooner i may have been happier and things may not have gotten so out of control out of hand like they did you know during all those years with her so maybe if i would've got out sooner i don't know i would've been happier i guess um it's okay to be selfish it's okay to you know think about yourself sometimes you know if you keep putting everyone ahead of you then you're not thinking about yourself you're not thinking about what makes you happy and even though pleasing people may make you happy uh you have to think about yourself sometimes too and about your needs because you know you play an important role in the lives of your close family members and um in order to keep everything afloat you sometimes gotta xxx gotta worry about the one person that's you know juggling everything and holding everything up which is yourself so be a little selfish sometimes it's okay <laughter> i don't even know what a weekend is anymore my ideal weekend would be locked away alone in my room watching movies listening to music just with my cell phone off and not you know being with anybody or it could be out at a bar you know or you know watching a a metal show so i like to be alone but at times i i do wanna be out with uh with others i like you know being around people crazy <laughter> he thinks i'm uh i'm crazy for coming out here but i guess he would say that i'm dedicated and that i'm strong-minded and that you know whatever i set my mind to i can do it you know no matter how hard it is i'm not gonna wimp out so i mean i i really respect him for giving me his insight but uh i guess yeah i guess he would say that i'm crazy but strong-minded <laughter> my kids <sigh> you know that's the one thing that brings joy to me you know like real real joy are my kids and you know just having them in my life is is the proudest thing i can ever accomplish is just you know having them in my life and although i don't get to see them as much even <e> even when i think about them just thinking about you know how far they've gone you know what what they've accomplished in their you know in in their short time i mean eh yeah it makes me happy and i can't wait to see them again one of my most memorable experiences i guess that would be scrubbed_entry in florida you know going to see our uh you know our favorite band skeleton witch it was it was a great night overall you know one of the night's i'll never forget just because we'd been looking forward to it for you know so many months and you know when it finally happened it was surreal um it was it was a great night after all and overall sure you're welcome bye,1
<synch> yes uh doing okay doing okay uh north carolina yep uh almost four years ago um i graduated college had an internship out here uh for a production company so i started doing that with a group of friends and then got work after that and enjoyed the city so much and have been working out here since yep uh probably three <th> at the most three times a year maybe twice usually the holidays maybe one random trip in there mhm um uh it's l_a's only now just starting to become home to me in the sense of that respect where like uh going home was going home now going home's like going back to see my family and seeing some friends um but um i i feel more i feel more like i belong in los angeles than i do back at home uh the food um the weather goes without saying uh i the <th> i like the resources there i like feeling um i like that uh the things that i wanna do uh are much easier much more accessible out here than they would be in north carolina so it i feel like i'm uh uh i'm able to uh pursue eh a lot of my passions ambitions in a much more functional and realistic way living in los angeles than i am in north carolina uh i mean the cost of living isn't great but at the same time too i always kind of tell people like part of the rent is having access to so much um resources <resour> so many resources out here so uh it's not even expensive as new york or boston so uh it's not the worst but um uh and also i mean it is a little bit annoying that every time i do wanna go home it's a flight not a drive i can't i mean conceivably <con> really conceivably drive home for the holidays 'cause it's about a three or four day adventure and just not practical so it's uh unfortunate that i'm so far away in that respect but i can't really change geography uh <laughter> <laughter> i studied uh history and uh media studies and production uh yes i work as a freelance writer and producer um in college i realized i was pretty good at it and uh i knew there was a way to monetize that and i came out here and uh worked a little bit uh in the uh public sector in trying to you know just doing those jobs that way and realized i could make more money have more control over my schedule and my life if i did it freelance so i've been doing it now for a little over a year now i do um i love traveling i try to uh go somewhere new for a good period of time about every uh seven to eight months just try to mix up things so i was in barcelona just recently and i'm planning on going to um either vietnam or even back to europe in next couple months so mhm uh i enjoy the break from routine i think that uh while it's nice to wake up and kind of have a vague idea where your day's going uh after a few months you can get very much kinda caught up in that and you uh pigeonhole i guess your thought process your expectations for the day and i love going to a foreign country and just waking up and knowing that everything i do that day is gonna be brand new and will be different than what i would be doing if i was in los angeles or and um our own routine so i i'm a big fan of that and i love the food so it's great to just eat um a lot of food that i love in the places where they were originally created uh yeah sure i went to uh barcelona uh like i said a few uh months ago and that was mainly because i had a friend who was living there for uh six or seven months and she kept asking me to come out and uh i finally i was at a point <p> point in work where i'd been working so much for months on end that i felt like i deserved a break so i went there for two weeks and yeah it was one of the healthiest smartest things i've done in awhile so i mm reminded me again how uh how important it is for me at least to uh to travel and to get out of the world i'm very outgoing i uh love talking to people and conversing even virtual people oop i lost ya um to relax i uh listen and play music a lot i like to read uh i like to go see movies uh cook i cook a lot so i enjoy cooking um uh my <m> my girlfriend and i are uh currently separated by distance um so i haven't seen her in weeks and that can be very uh sad obviously so i'll talk with her as much as i can but uh but yeah just uh um uh pretty simple tastes yep <participant is talking to rachel who has entered the room to fix a problem with ellie> <laughter> this is awkward isn't um i don't really have much of a temper so uh very good i guess i don't really get angry easily or quickly and uh when i do i'm usually aware of it enough that i can kinda formulate how i feel and why i'm feeling that way and what i want to be done about it so uh so it's pretty i guess i'm a pretty easygoing guy in that respect <sigh> uh honestly it was probably something petty over like uh misremembering when uh something was done or like a a date on something or like a a a fact probably wasn't anything emotionally fueled uh and it was just about yeah i think it was probably about like trying to figure out when exactly we went to san francisco and it wasn't even an argument as much as just the other person thinking the other person's misremembering so um in you know small or big situation it's very difficult for me to actually feel enraged uh i guess in the classical sense of the word um <sigh> i'm trying to think i'm not one one for regrets um um i just recently did a uh uh a project like a a film and uh the subject matter had a little bit to do with like an ex-girlfriend of mine so when it came time to release it uh i made a point i to i didn't wanna send it to her directly 'cause i didn't want her to think that i was doing to xxx her face but i did send it to her brother just because he enjoys my work and always says he wants to see stuff and i um uh maybe that <tha> she might've could've misconstrued that as being passive-aggressive i don't know um but um but yeah i mean that's something i i thought about but i don't really regret it as much as like maybe i could've just let uh everyone <ever> everyone else who i wouldn't wasn't necessarily sure about if i should do stumble upon it as opposed to me directing it to them so just my thoughts there <sigh> <laughter> hardest decision i've ever had to make <deep breath> ah um <sigh> uh it was actually probably uh probably that uh ah i don't even wasn't even a hard decision with like i said with that the the same ex-girlfriend that i mentioned of it was probably hard because uh i knew i had to uh break up with her after some stuff happened and um it was difficult 'cause i cared about her a great deal but also same tune it wasn't hard to arrive at the conclusion that i had to uh to uh break up with her but at the same time too it was not uh uh the easiest thing to kinda go through that process it's getting on a rollercoaster that you're very much aware of how mm terrible or frightening it's gonna be but you know you have to get on the rollercoaster so uh so yeah i'd say that's probably of recent memory ugh just a abundance of <laughter> reasons that uh this person was probably not the uh best person for me so uh like i said it was a it was i didn't have to uh i didn't have to weigh too much too much data to figure it out um it was pretty clear sign and i have no regrets about doing it now um i uh yeah i feel very strongly then about it and i felt i still feel very strongly that i made the right choice now um <sigh> it can be it can be tough there be <b> they'll be i feel like it's either if i if i've exhausted myself during the day between work and you know i've i've started exercising again which is a huge help but um but i'd say that it's i kind of when i get into bed at night i never know how it's gonna go sometimes it's uh sometimes i'll wake up within an hour of falling asleep and i can't go back to sleep or um i'll just yeah periodically keep getting up and up um so it's something that's gotten a little better in the last few weeks but uh yeah um like i said especially having my uh my current girlfriend uh not around like i said she's a very big source of comfort around so like that uh um but she travels a lot for work so it's something to have to adjust to and uh uh sleep can be can some that suffers from that but uh in the same respect i'm not someone who actually i feel like i don't need too much sleep i if i can get if i can get four to six hours i'm in pretty good shape that day so um uh little anxious i guess uh little more <mo> more just um uh i just whenever i get off of a assignment uh there's always just the question like what am i what's going on next and uh so far i don't have the next um project lined up so it's always that nervousness um in the past something usually does come up so you have the precedent of it usually working out but until it does you're always a little um uh anxious and it can be depressing 'cause it's like uh um you know i've chosen a very much a lifestyle that while i get to have a lot of control and autonomy over my life uh it also is all on me in order to do it and you know sometimes i'm i um i'm very jealous of the idea of people just waking up going to an office for eight hours leaving and not having to think about that work the minute they leave the office and kind of having the momentum of a group of people or or company um carrying them through when um it's a little tough whereas like me if i have an off day or if i'm a sick day um that no work gets done <laughter> you know i'm a small business that has one employee how do i cope with them um i assume you mean i guess uh people i work with how do i cope with the uh maybe the better answer would be how do i cope with that lifestyle and just i got much <m> uh much more used to it something i'm still learning and figuring out how to how to handle uh as far as not just like i know the the how rewarding the work is when i do it but it's also figuring out what's the most efficient way to live the life and you know how do i uh what's the appropriate way to budget finances what's the uh expectation i should have for myself in a given year what's realistic what's hopeful um and that's something that i'm sure will take years and years to do but i feel like as long as i'm getting better at it then uh it's progress right uh yes uh definitely once and then probably i if i would've gone back uh um i was gone in high school probably it would've been second time but um but yeah i've been diagnosed with depression once so i feel like it's one of those things that uh is something i have to keep in check throughout my entire life you know um i feel like i'm a pretty happy person for the most part but um uh has they i hate as annoying as it is but like they say like with people who are very creative or people who do a lot of stuff with the mind it tends to follow and i get that it's a self-esteem thing 'cause it's so hard to feel um so hard <har> or so easy i should <shou> suppose to get in your own head about that uh this was within a year so i probably was feeling uh symptoms having been there before it was kinda easy to figure out like ah you know it's kinda happening again so i feeling uh the symptoms again uh uh and going through those emotions and feeling like okay at first i was kinda hoping it would be something i could kind of work through myself but um i realized it was just stupid for me to try to fight the battle on my own so i went and um started seeing a therapist uh uh really bad this is when i i just couldn't sleep at all like i would get maybe an hour of sleep a night at best um i wasn't sleeping at all had just no <sigh> uh no no drive to do anything whether it was you know as simple as brushing my teeth or cleaning my apartment things like that and just being in the same time simultaneously being aware that it's like oh this is all in my head and it's not even like a a symptom so um uh yeah just a general just a general malaise that comes with depression uh no i just finished up uh finished up i mean since i didn't graduate or anything <anyth> like that but i got to a point where i felt like uh um i kind of talked through as much as i could talk through and i'd moved on eh in other places in my life it was in kind of a good good work xxx especially like i said i was i was working on something i really cared about um i'm now with someone i care about greatly and uh um there's such a potential opportunity for me to not even have to worry about the symptoms and stuff as much now that uh i felt like therapy was not necessary and also i just didn't really have the time to with as much work goes on so oh i definitely i think having someone you can confide in uh who isn't your friend or your family member who won't you know have a few drinks and tell someone what you said to them or anything like that is definitely a a something beneficial i can't imagine how anyone couldn't benefit from having that on a somewhat of a routine basis um <sigh> i don't know i'm i'm a firm <f> kind of a firm believer that the all those things like those things that kinda can haunt you are also there for a reason like uh uh my sister died when i was uh about <bout> what twelve years old and she was younger than me and watching my parents like seeing my father cry for the first time was a very kind of traumatic thing for me and it uh i felt like i grew up a lot that day so it's um also difficult to see that and see how my parents had to deal with losing a child i don't want to forget those things 'cause i think they're very integral to um how i cope with life and how i perceive uh um hardships and obstacles and uh having that image of knowing my father on it's very very humanizing 'cause it's so easy to kind of you idolize your parents and i still idolize my father but to know he's he's a guy like me and as i get older it's um easier identify with uh the man he is <psh> so i'd be uh sixteen or six um uh i kind of like the notion uh that uh they're they always say you wouldn't worry as much what people thought about you if you realized how people how much people didn't think about you and that's really hard to tell a sixteen year old and i don't know what the point of telling a six year old but um but yeah i feel like especially when you're in high school until it gets i mean nowadays you <y> i mean we live in los angeles where so much is caught up in how people think about you and i still am very if i find out someone eh either is upset with me or doesn't like me it bothers me to a great deal or i hate letting people down so i would like to come to a healthier place where just knowing that sometimes you just can't really control how people feel about you even if you have the best intentions in the world so uh i'm a very compassionate guy i um i'm there for my friends i'm pretty selfless in that respect i um have a good humor about things like even with <laughter> even with being depressed or depression i can joke about it it's not you know i'm not a morbid depressed more just the i'm aware of when i'm uh i'm low and uh i treat it as such and i don't you know i don't try to deny it i don't try to like any of that but i i i have a i'm a i'm a pretty like practical person in that respect i don't think uh even when i'm depressed i don't take it out on people or i don't think people people have told me they don't even seem to when i mention that <cough> been going through like depression no one seems to like or they don't mention i for one feel like when i do go through it it's like oh everyone can just tell and i'm just a smoking gun of sadness basically <laughter> but uh but no i i tend to carry it pretty well and uh um i don't i don't lose sight of uh the reality <rea> the reality of what i know is happening so mm um i was on a my uh my girlfriend came uh she was in thailand for three weeks and then she was supposed to go to spain for two but she canceled that trip and came back and stayed with me for about ten days and um yeah i know i <laughter> i love her she's great um she's the coolest person i know and so much fun and she uh when she's around she makes me so happy and uh um so having her for ten days and we just had like normal we we rarely get normal couples time like it's always like oh i see you for five days and then one of us has to go somewhere um so to have ten days just normal where we could just cook dinner at home like lie in bed and read books or anything like that was great and uh it makes me so happy that i have someone that i can do that with and just it feels so uh practical and feels so right um <sigh> i guess for xxx i'm i'm i'm a good guy like i i i know i don't uh i don't think i screw people over i don't um i'm a good friend to have i'm i'm there for people i look out for people i care uh about people and what they think of me and that goes especially much for my friends and i try to make sure you know with a lot of my friends being on the east coast i try to carve out time to make sure that they know i think about them and i call them and so i i feel like uh for a lot of people who count me as their friend i'm probably one of their better ones in just the sense that i'm i know how much i appreciate and respect uh the friendships we have thanks ellie bye,0
<synch> yes pretty good i grew up in boston about thirty years ago yep not too often maybe once a year sometimes less oh i love living in l_a i don't ever wanna live anywhere else well i came out here to go to college and i wanted to be far away from my parents and the weather was good and that's part of it uh very easy well maybe somewhat easy the beginning the first few weeks was really hard to just be in a new environment and to be away from everybody i knew but after a few weeks it was great broadcast journalism well it's something i'd wanted to do since i was twelve and everything i did from the time i was twelve until i went to college was sort of in pursuit of that dream no <laughter> well it's kind of a long story but i got laid off from my first job when i was in my twenties and it just once i had done that work i realized that's not really what i wanted to do it was too cut-throat of a business and it just really wasn't suited for me it didn't make me happy yep <sigh> my dream job is working with football players and helping them recover from concussions and other injuries <deep breath> well the work itself is not very hard i'm very good at what i do the hard part is finding the right people and making the connections to work with them it i used to i don't travel so much right now i love seeing different places and different things like i love going to places that are not like where i'm from my favorite trip is i went to australia for my thirtieth birthday 'cause i wanted to lose my thirtieth birthday as i crossed the international date line and i went to this really small <sigh> place up on the uh west coast of australia called shark's bay where native dolphins live and swim and is very isolated for the most part and i got to be there for a whole week and just really just pretty much by myself with all these wild dolphins and they come and they swim with you and it's amazing just a beautiful beautiful spot in the world more shy <sigh> <deep breath> why <sigh> hmm that's a good question um partly the first thing i think of is 'cause i've always been that way but maybe that's an excuse i don't know um <deep breath> i just prefer to be quiet and i'd rather be with fewer people than lots of people so <sigh> <deep breath> i watch t_v <sigh> a lot or that's probably not the best alternative but it is something i do and i also walk on the beach 'cause i live close to the beach so that's one of my favorite things to relax <deep breath> pretty good it depends on the situation but most of the time i'm pretty good <deep breath> um i don't think i tend to argue with people i think i just get mad about situations but not at people directly <sigh> <sigh> hmm <sigh> i don't know if i feel guilty about anything at the moment not sure i have one at the moment <deep breath> noise other people's noise makes me really mad um i live across the street from a bar and these people are so rude and obnoxious and not considerate about their neighbors that that just makes me really mad <sigh> yeah <sigh> hmm <sigh> well the only one that comes to mind off the top of my head is is when i bought my condo it felt like a really hard decision at the time you know i didn't know that i could do it i didn't wasn't sure if i had the money to do it um so that felt like a really difficult decision but in hindsight course it turned out to be a great decision but at the time it was really difficult to do that pretty easy i sleep pretty well <sigh> <deep breath> for the most part good i'm i'm just really worried about money <sigh> at the moment so that's my biggest so i can't say that i'm like great but i it's 'cause i am worried but you know i'm also confident that things are gonna work out nope <sigh> nope <sigh> hmm <sigh> i don't know i can't remember i mean i don't feel super happy all the time but i don't feel unhappy either sort of like just uh even keel well i got to go to the um my friends work at the motion picture academy so i get to see all the xxx oscar-nominated movies scrubbed_entry she was there one night so uh i really enjoyed catching up with her and seeing her again so that was very pleasant <sigh> <deep breath> i think they would say um reliable and loyal <sigh> and considerate and thoughtful <deep breath> no <sigh> i really have worked hard on that i think there are lots of things maybe i would do differently but there's nothing that really i regret um <deep breath> well i just think that there are things that um <sigh> like it's not worth wasting the energy to think about things that i regret so i don't have a lot of xxx regrets about things <deep breath> oh that's a good question <sigh> um <sigh> don't worry about the small stuff and save more money <laughter> like <deep breath> well there's uh you know the normal things like i'd lose more weight and i would um uh <sigh> think be a little more fearless maybe <sigh> be a little more bold i don't think i have any the of those <deep breath> well i'm i am self-employed so i work all the time <laughter> so my ideal weekend is having lots of clients um that's something i enjoy um so that would that would be ideal at this point my weekends if i were really busy <deep breath> that i've really been able to take care of myself and that you know i've done pretty much everything that i've said that i've wanted to do i've done that and i don't and i don't have regrets about things there's nothing really that eh is un feels undone in my life sure there's plenty of things i still wanna do um but i feel like i've done what i said i was gonna do <deep breath> yeah <sigh> that's not so great well it's okay um both my parents are deceased and i have a sister and a brother um i feel closer to my brother than my sister but um they both live on the east coast and i live in l_a um and then i have <ha> my sister has two girls so i feel very close to my nieces although we don't talk as much as we used to 'cause they're teenagers so they have other things on their mind <deep breath> um probably my teacher a person i learned my holistic body work from i really like to <sigh> model my work and my way of being after him like he's a a good role model for me the way he holds his work and the way he lives his life <deep breath> um we're pretty close we're not you know best of friends but i do i know that i can call him any time i need him um <sigh> put me in a good mood <sigh> usually being with my friends or going out to dinner or um <sigh> yeah just spending time with my friends okay thanks <sigh> bye,0
<sync> yes i'm doing fine indiana yes uh i don't know maybe ten years ago never uh just don't like the cold weather l_a has beautiful weather and activities all the time new life uh reasonably easy the good weather the ocean and there's always something to do hm uh the traffic sometimes seeing new places uh and visiting new people well a couple years ago i went to the catalina islands for my birthday i was i spent the whole day uh on the catalina islands i took a boat there uh hopping on the airplane and leaving indiana for good okay sleeping uh being a filmmaker because it's one job i haven't had yet not too hard shy hm because of my past um i just have trouble making new friends and just let <l> trusting people okay uh watch t_v or go to the movies i really don't have a temper when i was sixteen my stepfather uh because of uh nightmares i was having i was just having nightmares about my childhood about my involving my biological father so far i have no idea if they are or not uh go for a walk or drive uh maybe a few days ago uh just walked around the block a few times pushing people away uh i guess try to trust them a little bit more let them in my life little bit more well that'd be easy that'd be the first half of my life it'd be easier to start a new life if i can't remember my old one <laughter> uh really i mm all my decisions is not that hard i just try to avoid stress and everything so i don't really have hard decisions uh well every time i push someone away i wish i handled all those situations differently uh well uh whenever someone gets too involved <volve> involved in my life i always say or do something to make them want to stay away from me um this depending on the type of person they are uh i really don't have a relationship with any of my family i know i have a sister someplace in vegas a half of a brother in indiana uh my stepfather's in arizona other than that i have no relationship with any of them um we really don't talk so it's kind of hard to talk about them <laughter> edgar cayce well he died way before i was born and i only know him from like books and documentaries uh really not that easy um i usually <use> usually take me like a few hours to get to finally get to sleep once i lay down in my bed uh well basically i try to lay down i have stressful <s> racing or stressful thoughts a few times i might even try to listen to music for one hour just to see if it calms me down stressed out and just yeah just basically a little stressed out well i've been feeling a little bit lately <leet> a little bit upset and just wish my life was different uh well i wish i had friends and loved ones and all of that and i wish i had an actual relationship and everything but i don't well lately i live <li> i move we moved a bunch of stuff <st> things out my stress <st> life stressful things like bills and what not and just  try to keep uh to make sure there's the least amount of stress in my life by just removing just different things out my life and trying to incorporate new things yes i i guess we're number sixteen nightmares uh stopped a while back because it was getting too stressful well basically i just i just pushed like i got rid of them out my life because i didn't feel like they was really listening to me or anything and uh yeah so i just didn't feel too much beneficial help from them  so i've been looking for alternative means uh well just basically like music and going forcing myself to go to like different social related events yes depressed mm just but basically just depressed uh keeping myself locked in not talking to anyone uh uh i guess a few days ago okay well basically i feel that the best way to keep people in my life is having fake people in my life by playing online multiplayer games with avatars and user names and everything and i just have some uh fun going into virtual worlds with these avatars and talking to people that way so they don't know who i really am they don't even know my real name okay well my ideal weekend uh let me see is uh if i'm not working that weekend i will get up maybe go to like starbucks or a mcdonalds get online while eating or drinking something maybe play a online multiplayer game for a little while and then later on in the day maybe go to a movie uh whatever's playing then uh go someplace else relax watch some t_v um and maybe put on a d_v_d movie and um or i might spend the day i the whole day driving to someplace i  haven't been before or it's been a long time since i've been just try to spend the day in that area and just yeah so that's the weekend my life i just regret how my life turned out i wish i wish i had a more normal stable life uh let me see ten twenty years ago i was especially uh i would just tell myself to keep a journal or something <s> uh or  to basically tell myself how my life will turn out now so that way hopefully the other me will make different choices uh my mind well i wish i wish i was a bit healthier i wish i looked a little bit better i wish my eyesight was a lot better and i wish i had a bunch of people in my life that i could call friends um i'm a freaking genius i could uh everything that i'm good at i learned self taught so basically i can't get a career in that type of stuff unless i go to school for it but it's hard to it's basically easier if i teach myself than like take some type of a class to do it and everything 'cause yeah basically <bay> yeah just basically the fact i'm a freaking genius okay thank you have a good day,1

<synch> yes okay virginia i wanted to live somewhere different than virginia with a little bit more diversity um once a year maybe it's um it's a lot slower and there's a lot less to do there um i wanted to live somewhere different and a nicer warmer climate and um somewhere where there's a lot more to do and there's a lot more going on for me it was really easy 'cause i wanted something <someth> it was very different and i wanted something different i like um i like all the things to do like the museums i like the beaches and the mountains and all the hiking and all the free things to do mm people don't appreciate what they have here that just come here and wanna take something but they don't wanna give anything back and bad drivers uh not as much as i would like to i travel whenever i can but usually can't afford to that much mm well i like taking i like taking pictures a lot and i just like exploring new places my wife and i like to see um wildlife and hike and monuments and just seeing different areas um well <sigh> we we've gone <go> we went to uh central california we'd like to be able to go more internationally places but that takes awhile to afford so we've gone more locally so we went to um we went to hurst castle and to see the sea lions <li> the um the elephant seals and things like that um i guess our uh i guess our palm springs trip for our anniversary we did the um eh we did the tram and a nice hotel and jacuzzi and romantic dinner and it was a good time overall i guess somewhere in between english and film well i uh was told i needed to go to college and i hadn't quite decided what to do yet so i just picked something i liked to do for the time being well wish i'd not been pressured so i had more time to figure out what i wanted to i might've done something different like physical therapy but uh no i've been teaching <t> teaching gymnastics which is something i used to do before um i needed to not starve and i did it i didn't end up being as bad as i thought it would be so i went for it and it ended up being kinda fun dream is to have money and not have to work for it overall pretty good um don't remember what about but it probably would've been few weeks ago with my wife um well anyone that i've ever actually gotten upset and yelled i always wish i wouldn't do that but sometimes when someone's not listening it drives me crazy um you know if i just saying something over and over and they're just clearly not listening it makes me really upset um <sigh> i don't know i i spend a lot of time on 'em but i don't i don't know what the hardest one is 'cause eh if i decide to go with something it's you know it's usually for a good reason well i guess i feel guilty about moving to california and that i left my family in virginia i mean <pft> i know i shouldn't but they always seem to miss me and even though they don't like living there you know i'm the one that moved away so it's like i abandoned them well i mean i don't miss virginia but i do miss them so i guess a little hard uh i have a good relationship with my <deep breath> with my wife with my in-laws with my mom dad and sister there's no problems everyone gets along well mm very close um i mean anything <anyth> anything where someone gets hurt either uh physically or otherwise it depends on how much exercise i have get a lot of exercise it's pretty easy if i don't it's not um kind of like right now just a little bit slow and out of it but not really um too different otherwise um just kinda run down 'cause my um my mother-in-law is is dying and we just spent like three days uh in the hospital and we're gonna go back after this so not a lot of time to sleep mm just um just uh slower <sl> just slower and more tired and little more out of it that's all no no um usually just when i'm having <havi> having a fun day either on my own or with my wife that's that's pretty easy for me just getting outside and and uh and hiking or exercising it's not hard for me i'm not sure maybe um maybe mm like eccentric but in a good way hopefully no um to be careful with your to be careful with your job to make sure you could keep from being injured and to um i don't know just your <y> just your normal your normal kind of uh older kinda wisdom <sigh> mm not much to say really everyone realizes things when they get older that they wish they had when they were younger uh i wish i could get rid of my back injury so i could get back into shape like i used to be that's um the biggest thing right now um not much to say just hurt my back at work and i just like to get past it 'cause it's you know holding me back from doing a lot of things that's all um well like i used to do uh gymnastics and trampoline and used to be a lot more active or work out more and now i can only work out a little bit 'cause it hurts too much um probably like during the during the day going <sigh> going on a hike or to a park with my wife and uh enjoying taking pictures and wildlife and exercising and then at night um you know we watch a movie or go dancing or just something like that um most proud of um proud of moving here i mean i um came here without knowing anyone and i was at a point where i could've stayed in virginia and gotten comfortable and you know ended up doing something i regretted but i came out and i've always thought that was a good decision mm my parents my grandparents my wife most people in my life have been bye bye,0
<sync> yes i'm pretty good uh as far as my parents ethiopia yes um the beaches the warm weather um the diverse environment uh traffic <laughter> well i'm currently in school i'm studying african studies uh i've always been interested in african studies actually i've always wanted to help people and i figured that i could help them by trying to learn about it and going back to africa and make an influence kind of in between i have my shy moments but then when i'm around a group of people that i enjoy i'm pretty outgoing um to relax i normally write or i go to the beach and just sit there play my guitar pretty good i don't really get angry or anything like that i tend to keep it in or try to release it by writing um i actually can't remember the last time i argued with someone mm all the people i've hurt in the past uh i've like cheated on people hurt their feelings intentionally done things that i shouldn't have done that i regret now mm um well with my ex i could've ended it better so we could be on better terms now um i probably shouldn't have argued so much or tried to instigate so many things i probably should've just let it go with the flow and just see how it turned out um hardest decision i've ever had to make was man i really don't know actually um having to see my dad go through surgery and see him suffer um well he had a tumor that he had to get removed so it was just hard seeing him have to be in the bed and just be in the hospital when he really didn't want to be there 'cause he's a really live person and he'd rather be running around and stuff like that but just seeing him stuck in bed was just terrible uh me and my family aren't very close we don't i mean they've always been there for me and i appreciate it but we've never had that close connection <collection> connection <con> connection um especially since they're foreign so they don't really understand where i'm trying to come from having been grown up out in america so it's pretty different when it comes to those cultural <cu> racial i mean the cultural boundaries that we kinda step each over each other's feet on but aside from that we have a decent relationship when we do speak to each other it does get kinda awkward but it's okay i think they are out of control i think that they're learning things that they shouldn't know at this age i think that they're doing things that they shouldn't be doing and i don't feel like enough people are telling them that they shouldn't be doing it i feel like they're being applauded by the media they're being applauded by celebrities that they follow and there's not enough being done about it and they're just getting lost um depends on the night some nights it's pretty hard some nights i fall asleep like a baby um usually creative actually when i can't sleep i'll just stay up and i'll write something or read a book and ideas will pop up um stuff like that it's usually a good thing when i can't sleep it's nothing really bad 'cause i'm having bad thoughts or anything like that um lately between a mix of good and bad i have my happy moments when i'm energized and i'm live then some nights some days where i'm just you know just sitting there just mellow thinking not like my live self i don't know it's just always been like that always have those ups and those downs but they kind of balance each other out no no um the last time i felt really happy was hm today uh just from the moment i woke up it was a beautiful sunny day i went to see some friends we had a good time went to school had some good grades on some papers um wrote a good essay feel pretty accomplished and i feel like my day is just a good day my best friend would describe me as odd <laughter> most people would describe me as odd i say a lot of odd things i do odd things i'm interested in things that most people aren't um just like old literature um revolutionary stuff uh stuff about changing the world but through underground means um no i i don't live a life of regret to never let fear stop you from doing anything um reading just hanging out with some friends driving around finding something to do just going on an adventure i don't wish i could change anything about myself i just wish i could build myself into the person that i'm truly supposed to be um this one time me and my best friend got into an argument and she pointed out all the things i've done that i shouldn't have done all at one time how i've hurt people how i've hurt her the ways i've done them that were brutal and it just made me feel bad once i reflected on it all uh my parents i mean although we don't see eye to eye they always bring me to this realization that i need at the end of the day although i never listen to them or i don't choose to listen to them once it happens i learned from it and i'm like oh that's what my parents told me so i learned to trust them more and i learned to understand that they are wiser than me and they do know more than me um not so much anymore um i travel around l_a try to find new sights to see but as far as i don't travel outside um discovering new things um discovering things you never knew were there or the limitless possibilities um i discover i like i enjoy discovering new people new cultures new things that go against what's normal for us and for myself um a few days ago i just drove out to the middle of the desert and i just sat there and i just enjoyed all that the desert had to offer and it was just enjoyable um i felt free away from all this these cities and these buildings and it just felt nice to be out in the middle of nowhere at a completely random time it felt good i'm most proud that i've always been different that despite how many people have told me that i'm really weird or i'm odd or i think weird things i've always maintained my original mentality,0
<sync> hello  yes  okay not too bad i'm from chicago south side um back in nineteen seventy eight when i was eighteen yes <y> lately not much maybe once every two or three years um it's totally different you know horrible weather and uh yeah it's just a whole different atmosphere um let's see my mother had moved to africa i graduated from high school and i had a friend out here so i just thought well let me try l_a uh very easy actually yeah i loved it from the moment i got off the airplane yeah number one the weather um sun is very important to me so i love the weather um i don't know just kind of a more laid back atmosphere variety of people and now it's my um my home base you know my friends that are family so it's kinda like my family is here now hmm i guess the smog earthquakes um traffic just basic things like that really um i don't currently but i did throughout my life i traveled quite a lot uh just seeing seeing other cultures and seeing um more history and meeting  people and just fun and the the fun of it as well um let's see well one trip i went to england ireland and scotland and france all in you know one trip so that was a nice variety um i guess you could say probably skiing in val d'isere france that was fun i'm glad i got to do that i'm kind of shy by nature i've tried to grow out of being shy so i'm not fully shy but i was always a an extremely shy child but now here in culver city this is my environment and i i guess you could say i'm not really shy in in my hometown of culver city hm to relax i like to just curl up in my bed and read my book take a nap watch t_v sometimes on the couch in the living room just you know stay at home and kinda vegetate uh pretty good yeah my temper's pretty level hm probably with my husband and i can't remember at the moment what it was about um well when you say my family do you mean my  family from childhood or my current family okay well i guess my current family comes to mind i i have two daughters and my relationship's pretty good it's okay with them but they're teenagers which uh you know going they're going through a lot of hormones and um they can be kinda bitchy <laughter> and and um but i have hoped that you know they'll grow out of that and soon someday we'll have a really good relationship um and then there's the husband which i i guess i could say soon to be ex husband hopefully soon  <laughter> we need to get a divorce but we're still together due to financial reasons and yeah yeah so that that's not good the the relationship with the husband but um but since we have determined that we need to divorce our our we don't expect anything out out of each other so we don't argue as much so that's good hm well i guess our marriage i wish i had noticed early on that you know it was like way off from what i thought it was um <sigh> let's see oh my god hardest decision i guess leaving my first husband that was pretty hard um well you know we were married and i wasn't content i guess you could say um and i kinda just gave up on our relationship and i i now that i look back i think it's because i wanted children and he would've been happy to never have any and so uh since i didn't have a father it was very important that i create children with someone who really wanted to be a father and so i was kind of at a age where i needed to start thinking about having children yet i was with someone who really was not into it so that i think that's one uh maybe the core reason why i was not content and i just felt like <tisk> this marriage isn't gonna work and so you know we went to therapy and everything and he did not wanna break up and <tisk> um <tisk> and i had to leave him because i just wasn't happy and that was that was very  hard 'cause you know i felt like i was hurting him  which which i was you know and he survived he got over it now he's  married with two kids <laughter> <laughter> but um it was hard to leave him mm something i wish i could erase from my memory i have to think about that i'm sure there's something <gasp> oh well yeah there's um i guess it'd be nice to erase from my memory  um a recent i mean not recent but an event in my recent adulthood here in culver city where one of my best friends um i've betrayed me by back years ago when my husband first got into real estate she and her family were growing and they really needed  a larger home and um we just assumed that you know that they would use my husband as their agent both to sell their current home current at the time and purchase a new home <tisk> and as it turned out they surprised us and had been talking to this other local agent and uh yeah that was devastating i don't think i had ever  been betrayed like that so i wish i could  erase that now 'cause now you know this was back when the kids were really young and um my daughter at the time my youngest daughter was let's say six maybe um maybe five anyway her <h> her and my best friend's daughter are the same age they were born within days of each other we were pregnant together and um they were really tight those two little girls and they ended up not going to the same elementary school  so they didn't get to hang out during those years but every time we'd run into them in the neighborhood or they'd run into each other at a summer camp or something they were just so connected they were just you know like two peas in a pod even though it's her their moms weren't talking to each other anymore so now they're thirteen and fourteen and they're in middle school together and they're still very connected in fact <laughter> she she for the first time spent the night at our house last night with my daughter and another girl and it's just a little awkward you know 'cause now these girls are becoming really good friends better friends um and yet i still have this vivid um bad memory of what her her mom did to to me that was about what ten about eight years ago anyway <sigh> i tried to i tried to ignore it and put it out of my head and which i've been able to <sniff> in recent years but obviously it still comes up anyway that that was that <sniff> um not that easy i do sometimes get a decent night's sleep but sometimes it's hard to get to sleep and most of the time i wake up and can't get back to sleep uh or i finally get back to sleep and then it's almost time to get up you know that that difficult thing well the waking up in the middle of the night is definitely triggered by having to go to the bathroom <laughter> and then um <tisk> you know it's not always that easy to get back to sleep and then i wake up again to go to the bathroom so i guess that's the trigger as far as getting to sleep having a hard time there i don't know i think there's just too much on my mind running through my mind and the day i feel like i haven't accomplished enough during the day so it's hard for me to just go to sleep when i'm supposed to i guess um well i'm kinda used to it now so i just go on through the day probably looking <laughter> looking tired and um i i'm kinda used to feeling tired i just do what i need to do and sometimes if i'm able to if i'm at home and don't have huge commitments yeah i might just like i said earlier just take a nap or something read my book watch t_v watch whatever lately how have i been feeling um kind of down on myself down on life well i have this pending need <n> need for separation slash divorce um <tisk> i worry that i made a lot of mistakes with my girls now they're teenagers you know on the verge of adulthood <clears throat> and so i worry that you know i did all kinds of things wrong with their guidance and their early childhood and  <clears throat> now it's too late um like i missed out on a thing <th> a lot of things uh and yeah i need a job i'm unemployed i don't know what i wanna do with my life i know i wanna do something i i i just wish you know i never did finish college unfortunately because i was traveling and stuff so i i regret that extremely and i need to get a job and be able to take care of myself 'cause i need to divorce and move on with my life so now i forget what the original question was but  <laughter> um that's the state part of the state of my life no yes mm <tisk> well the first time or or or recently the first time i guess was you know when i was in my early twenties i was just a little upset about <laughter> coincidentally that was another breakup i had to make back then i was um <tisk> in my early twenties and i needed to break up with my boyfriend but again it was very upsetting 'cause i you know it was hard because he didn't wanna break up and i felt like i was hurting him and i didn't understand this feeling i was really upset how i didn't that was my first time having depression so i didn't really recognize <r> recognize it as depression but i went somehow i had the knowledge or the i was able to take myself to a psychiatrist i remember i paid for her by the hour and she prescribed xanax to just help relax me and so i guess that helped me get through that and then i've had depression throughout the years just you know little bits here and there for various reasons such as i guess it's usually a relationship <laughter> you know um yeah so the most recent time i was diagnosed and put on meds that was probably about two years ago no um money i i don't have insurance otherwise yeah i'd be happy to go to therapy <laughter> anything that might help ooh <laughter> boy last time i felt really happy um i don't know i guess maybe when my children were born that's <laughter> um i guess happy i don't know <laughter> i just you know i always wanted children so it was nice to have them that's i don't know that's all i can remember of that i don't i guess i don't remember the good times too well <laughter> i remember the bad times <sniff> mm something i did that i really enjoyed well let's see i um friday night i went to a friend's house and met up with five other girlfriends and we we created vision boards and talked and had dinner at one of their house that was that was fun yeah we get to ooh <sigh> stay in college get my degree um get therapy try to become a happy um yeah try to figure out things earlier in life like yeah stay in college and oh and mainly i think the main you know what it all boils down to <laughter> no matter what you're depressed about it seems like as as the saying goes and the songs <s> the songs go you know it's all about money the world revolves around money and having none that in itself is very depressing <laughter> so besides relationships and different things  that have happened in your life having no money is you know it's like you can't even try to fix anything because you don't have the money to fix it so with that in mind i would uh definitely advise myself to get my college degree and to stick <s> get a job and stick with it um don't quit to go traveling you know just stick with a job stick with a company build up your seniority keep your benefits and build up some knowledge or some expertise in some sort of field yeah that would've been my biggest piece of advice to myself not much <laughter> i guess just my daughters you know they're beautiful daughters and i'm proud and glad that i was able to have children some people aren't even able to do that you know and they  try so hard or they look back on their life and they wish they had done it so that's the one thing i mean i wanted five children and i always wanted a boy which i never had but um i'm i guess that's the biggest thing i can think of to be proud of is having my two daughters um i'm a very loyal friend and person that's why when that friend betrayed me it was so devastating yeah very loyal um very <inhale> happy <hap> i mean huh what was i gonna say i was gonna say happy lucky <l> go lucky i don't know where that came from i'm very i meant to say friendly and caring and um yeah i care about people and i'm interested in people and i care about animals as well actually that's another thing i'm proud of proud of being a vegetarian yeah so my daughters and being vegetarian i'm a vegetarian because i really care about feelings of other beings not only humans but animals too and you know i don't think that animals should be  tortured and live a a tortuous life just so we can eat 'em so um what was the question do you remember the question okay you're welcome bye,1
<sync> yes <clears throat> i'm actually feel <f> i feel pretty good 'cause i uh i slept all day yesterday almost and i usually i'm doing something if it's not work it's school if it's not school it's work and then social life and all that so um i actually didn't have work yesterday and i don't have school i only have school on the weekdays so i actually slept probably like eighty five percent of the day so i actually feel kinda good but i'm actually kinda tired as well and i have other stuff going on but other than that i'm good today i'm originally from bakersfield california really uh i moved to l_a when i was an infant and then i left here when i was around three or four and i've been move i moved back here in oh seven and i've been living here um ever since um wow since i've been here since oh seven i've only been back maybe <clears thoat> maybe like a couple times <ti> well i went there for like a summer like in oh eight i think i was there for like almost the whole summer but i've only been back a couple times um since i've been back here unfortunately uh <sigh> uh <laughter> uh it compares to l_a um it doesn't really compare to l_a i i grew up in sacramento actually i didn't get to tell you i was born in bakersfield then i lived here and then i anyways i don't know if i did i forgot anyways um yeah there's like nothing really to do there it's really small it's the valley um l_a has all the stuff to do it has um oceans and it's by all kinds of um located um by a lot of um cool places like vegas and uh san diego and what have you not so <s> um but yeah other than that i miss my friends and stuff but i don't miss like the actual city i just miss uh some of the people that i grew up with oh i can't see your shoes but um i don't travel a lot actually i've only been out of california like six times so i would like to travel once i uh have enough money to do so um well originally i wanted to be a filmmaker and which i still wanna be a filmmaker and i um studying <stu> i was took i took communications and uh did general ed stuff too and um took like video production classes and um <tisk> <lip smacking> did a lot of stuff uh in regards to um filmmaking and i have learned a lot of stuff and i still have that knowledge however i haven't really used it since i've been back here in l_a i did all that stuff in northern california in sacramento but um and then i transferred <trans> um switched over to be uh to business which i took some classes in that but now i'm actually studying to be an optician and i'm actually almost done with schooling and getting ready to try to get in the field and become an optician so but i do wanna be uh i actually still wanna be a filmmaker and um that's still one of my plans and i still actually i got into um playing poker a few years ago and i really like the idea of becoming a full time filmmaker or full time poker player however both of those jobs are extremely difficult to make a living out of and you have to be like the small percent so we'll see if not then hopefully my optician career can take me somewhere to be an optician oh um uh i guess i was just trying to find something that it was like it's like a trade it's well it's a private college but it just like specifically trains you into um one field and you just learn that you don't do like your g_e and all these other classes like you normally would do for like um like a um a major or whatever you're gonna do so it just trains you specifically to be an optician and jump in the field i um took it just because i actually want <w> want to be a dental assistant and since <si> it sound like something maybe i could do it sounds interesting but then the counselor actually um got my attention to be an optician so i'm now trying to be an optician and it's interesting so it's fun it's um really hard but it's interesting and it and it um and it's it's fun it has um rewarding um rewarding benefits as far as like being able to help people see better and feel comfortable with glasses or contact lenses whatever they feel more comfortable with cool uh i'm definitely outgoing however i can be shy sometimes like i'm kinda shy right now because talking to you and you're uh in a computer and you're a cartoon or uh animated or whatever <laughter> so cool but no usually ninety eight percent <laughter> um i actually which it is actually kinda funny and i think maybe this might go for some of the poker players too um i don't really i've never really talked to any professional poker player but as far as like um i actually playing poker is um actually something that helps me forget about anything as far as like um stuff in the past or present um or future stuff that's coming up uh as far as like i am really relaxed <rela> i really um could just not think about anything and just think about poker and it actually it's kinda like a therapy thing for me 'cause i don't like i guess you could say it's a kinda drug because um i don't think about anything as far as like stressed out or depressed or stuff that's happened in the past i just like focus on poker so it's actually kinda relieving however playing poker is very stressful on top of that so i guess it's kind of like um catch twenty two or whatever but uh yeah so no poker i play like to play basketball i like to watch movies i like to go to the beach actually one of the things i like to do is go to the beach 'cause it does um it makes me feel good but it i didn't go i usually only go to the beach when it's hot not during the cold season so it's coming up soon so i'm looking forward to that i'm gonna be busy but uh i'll try to go out to the beach as much as i can <laughter> um i'm really good at controlling my temper actually i've only been in like i'm thirty years old i've been in like six fights maybe and all six of 'em were started by the other person so i've never started a real fight in my whole life like i started fights when i was a little kid but talking about like real stuff like once you get passed it at like thirteen fourteen <sniffle> uh but yeah no i'm good like every now and then like there's been a couple times maybe in the past where like i wasn't able to control it but um as far as like ever being violent or anything that's never occured and never would but for um majority of the time yeah i don't have like people do stupid things all the time and i just like let it go especially like um on the freeway and stuff but uh oh well i mean i argued a bit with my ex girlfriend a lot but uh it was just about really um petty things i guess that maybe we just i think we were good for each other but uh maybe some other lifetime because uh we just bumped heads too much so obviously she's my ex girlfriend probably for a reason so we just argued about girlfriend boyfriend things uh um i guess my filmmaking <filmm> um handled differently there's a lot of stuff i could've handled differently but uh uh maybe like when i was doing really good when i was younger and i was um working for scrubbed_entry production assistant for filmmakers around um where i lived in sacramento so i was doing everything that i wanted to do as far as my dreams are concerned and had a lot all my stuff together i had my own car my own apartment and then i got involved with like uh the wrong group of people i guess and kinda tumbled downhill from there and like lost everything like car job apartment so i just wish that maybe i never got involved with those kind of people that kinda of girl um uh ever uh because <clears throat> i woulda probably it probably my life probably would be a lot different now however i believe that everything happens for a reason and obviously i think you should also like if stuff happens good or bad uh <sigh> uh learn from your other mistakes so that when it happens again you could um not make that mistake or try not to make it as bad i guess so you know mm hardest decision i guess i guess uh hardest decision the hardest decision i have ever had to make would be um i guess you could say uh i don't really know was gonna say that uh maybe like my ex girlfriend like i could've like stayed with her and i really like still am in love with her and uh would like to be with her and miss her but i guess the biggest mistake <mis> um decision that i had to make was like i know that it wasn't like a healthy relationship and i know if we like stayed together or if we got married or had kids that i don't think it would end up working out anyways so i guess the decision my hardest decision would be to like actually stay away from her and not get back with her and uh be uh not with her so i guess that was a hard really hard decision because um i could easily have done it and i guess maybe i would've been happier in that way but stressed out and um irritable or whatever and the other way of having to deal with her i guess deal with each other our our relationship so it was really hard still is so uh i guess that's it not choosing to be with someone that i i loved and loved me or whatever so cool oh what was that i beg your pardon nevad i don't understand the first part of that question oh an event oh an event okay um that i could erase <sigh> uh event that i could from my memory uh my ex girlfriend i wish i'd never met her my first girlfriend and my last girlfriend i wish i never met them 'cause uh we <w> we were together in love for a few years and then we broke up and it was really hard so i guess both of them oh it's extremely easy i could fall asleep anywhere i actually the other day i broke a record i almost fell asleep standing up which would've been weird because i guess i would've fallen down or something i don't know i just caught myself i guess i was really <r> i mean i was really tired but i i do a lot of stuff so it's hard for i don't really get that much sleep as much as i would like <l> like but i could sleep when i'm dead or whatever so as they say <tisk> uh no no uh lately i'm just tired but i'm alright i guess i'm dealing with this breakup still it's only been like a month an a week but it's actually it's not i mean i've had worse things happen i mean worse things happen had worse things happen so yeah i guess <sigh> well i'm a religious person i'm catholic i believe in god i know there's a god so um i obviously even all of it even devoted people to god um regardless of what they are they uh sometimes lose faith so i do lose faith sometimes but it doesn't really last for that long and i know that there is a god i know that i'll be okay and that everything will be okay but you know it's hard um deal with them i i don't really i just keep going you know go to school and work and i just have to keep going i can't give up so i just try to stay busy and staying busy helps kind of and like sleeping a lot helps but i don't get to sleep a lot so um i don't know uh playing poker playing basketball deals helps me deal with it and like uh hanging out with my friends helps me sometimes why uh uh uh i felt really happy on friday because um i went to san diego for the first time and uh i didn't it wasn't as cool as i thought it was gonna be but uh we were like under circumstances as far as like my friend had business to take care of and it took a long time so i would've much rather been free during that time but i wasn't but we had fun and it was cool uh i enjoyed it so yeah i really liked uh i was had fun and i was happy about going to san diego for the first time and i um had a good time oh she's <sigh> um <laughter> a lot of things but i guess i would say like be nicer to like um family members you know a couple family members that i wish i would've been different to um acted different to not that i was like a horrible but i could've been nicer in some instances that if i didn't know the situation at hand uh i would've never like really um went out and partied all the time like i did like high school and different part times of out of high school i would've just really focused on um schooling and stuff and then did the partying later uh wouldn't have gotten relationships that um so i would've just told myself more basically to be more uh have more direction be more focused i guess uh stay away from people and unhealthy relationships unhealthy people i guess not that i'm the healthiest but <sniffle> um yeah i just would've done a lot of stuff different but i um i don't know if i said this earlier but i believe everything happens for a reason um so i guess everything's happening now for a reason so i'm just gonna keep going <laughter> uh <tisk> i guess they would the few that i do have or few that i used to have 'cause i have best friends now a couple i guess one new one and i've lost a few best friends as far as like just not we like went out own ways but i guess they would all probably describe me more as like um happy <ha> energetic uh funny crazy uh loud uh silly uh smart and uh i just in i guess in uh in general just like entertaining to be around have i haven't always <a> always been the best bestest best friend but i try you know my hardest so that's it like cool um <sigh> change myself uh <tisk> i wish i was um <xxx> i wish i was like fifteen pounds lighter um i wish i didn't need uh how do i say put this uh i feel like um i feel like i'm a i feel like i i need to be like in a relationship with a girl i feel like i wish i didn't have to be like feel like that i needed to have a girl all the time and so i could that could help me like focus more and i wish that like i didn't need sexual um i wasn't always thinking about sexual stuff towards girls all the time as far as like me having to be in a sexual thing with them like as far as like wanting sex as much as i do 'cause i feel like if i didn't concentrate or have to do like get be with girls or in a relationship to like well who i don't know how to say it but i'm just saying like i there's like guy friends that i know that don't need sex as much as i do and i feel like i need it more than i feel like sometimes that i wish i didn't need <n> need it as much so maybe i guess i'm addicted to it a little bit where like i i could focus on more things other than just i mean i don't just focus on sex but i just feel like if focus on if i didn't want it need it or think i need it as much that i could get more stuff done in my life but yeah so i'm trying i'm working on that <deep breath> <sigh> what am i most proud of uh i'm most proud of <makes sounds with mouth> the the i'm most proud <prou> oh i guess i guess i'm most proud of working for um television station back in sacramento and working on a lot of um film sets 'cause like i i was sixteen and i decided i wanted to be a fimmaker and then two years later a year and a half later basically i got i started making steps to become a filmmaker and then i ended up working <wor> working in the business and working as a filmmaker for a really really um really um good um cinematographer a really good um freelance cinematographer that was based that lives in sacramento they did a lot of things so i'm proud that had a dream and i went for it and i and actually ended up doing stuff to go towards my dream that were in my dream so um yeah i guess that's one of my biggest accomplishments which was like over ten years ago but i you know hopefully something like that could happen again soon or you know so perfect goodbye,0
<sync> yes i am i'm doing great i am originally from venezuela i was two years old yes i was um been only once i do not have family there anymore uh my uh siblings live in florida nowadays wow there's so many things i like about l_a i like the weather i like people overall i think the weather we're very lucky here traffic uh i have traveled some meeting new people and doing new learning about new cultures i enjoy languages uh traveling itself i have traveled to italy uh i lived there for seven and a half years and i studied abroad i've uh visit a few countries through europe and i had a real good time um probably traveling uh through rail along europe and getting to know cities in that way totally outgoing i do meditation um it's usually a practice that you can becomes very natural so my body's able to um sense when i'm not feeling at ease and i naturally um breathe and start my meditation process mm it could be hard if you don't practice it every day or if you're not able to quiet your mind however if you um meditate for a long time it becomes a practice like going to the gym or drinking your daily water um you can naturally learn to meditate i think pretty good i typically do not argue uh and i don't remember any instance of arguing with someone recently maybe being on the freeway and taking the wrong exit <laughter> i would've probably paid attention to uh my uh probably g_p_s or not being over confident hardest decision i ever had to make uh i guess moving back from europe to l_a  coming back home <laughter> i miss my friends it was time to come back i had done my schooling and it was time to come back home see my parents and join my family i love my family they're the core of my life i have a nephew he's uh six years old and he's the love of my life love them all my teachers uh my parents and definitely my mentors well i don't think i have anything that bad that i want to erase from my memory um i can't think of any sorry <laughter> guilty about i don't think i have anything to feel guilty about however sometimes i feel guilty when i eat a lot of cookies 'cause that is not good for my health <laughter> very easy i sleep like a baby once i hit the bed <laughter> i've been feeling good no i felt really happy about two months ago i went to a friend's birthday she celebrated in a casino by a city away from los angeles san bernadino and i was playing with a twenty five cents with quarters and i won like seventy five dollars in the machine so that was very cool <laughter> uh outgoing always planning something exciting to do um very outspoken mm not that i know of no oh always do what you want to do life is short and um always keep on learning uh i want to lose two more pounds i i've been very very blessed i've never really felt anyone make me feel bad and i usually interact well with everyone i meet and i'm very blessed to have everyone be nice to me i'm a great listener uh i spend quality time with my friends and family uh not quantity necessarily but quality time and i'm very supportive and i love to pretty much listen listen and listen sometimes that's all people need i went to school um i have two degrees um business management um uh degree and also i have a language degree i learned languages when i was very little uh had the opportunity to travel and it was easier for me to keep on learning languages and uh the business part i enjoy interacting with people creating um new ideas uh innovating so i believe that's where my interested in uh business came from mhm yes i am <laughter> my dream job one that wouldn't have probably challenges every day uh one that i could uh i don't know i'd just come to the office and everybody and everything would be perfect but uh it's not real so uh i think one of the main things about having a a job is enjoying those challenges very proud of myself uh my accomplishments and i'm also very proud of my family and my friends and how they have uh uh achieved and overcome their obstacles um sure i have a friend of mine who is now in new york state university she had quite some challenges trying to get there and funding her education and now she is um uh not only in the school but she hosts has acquired uh some funding for her education through a lot of writing letters and petitions and things she did in order to conquer her dream to be in school so very proud of her thank you goodbye,0
<sync> yes uh i'm fine today today is my daughter's birthday california yes um the beach i love the waters the gang violence violence um i lost a lot of friends growing up in um through elementary and high school just losing them through gang violence yeah thank you it was pretty tough out there <laughter> um haven't been to any place out of california yet so not really um i'm an optician i'm a certified optician and i also have my associate's degree um actually i went in i didn't really know what i wanted to do when i first applied i just knew i wanted to change my life and do something successful um before i settled down and you know had my daughter and everything um actually my guidance counselor kind of helped me and i i always thought like they were so cool 'cause their white long lab coats to be a optometrist um 'cause i'm already an optician and that's like the first step and um what i why is a good question it's because then i would have a be able to have my own business and i would have something successful to leave to my daughter and she wouldn't have to really want to anything it would be like a a family business but a a to help the community as well and something i could leave for my daughter uh my daughter she's five years old uh she'll be starting elementary school next week and today is her birthday uh five years ago i had her <laughter> um she is very smart um i taught her home i home schooled her for five years and um she's adorable she's my heart no this is like the hardest job ever <laughter> it's very hard providing providing uh making sure that you wash their clothes um 'cause 'cause i mean it's hard enough to be um a parent but i'm a young parent and i'm a little more mature than her father so it's um it's it's the providing part i would basically say making sure that you have everything that they need it's so complicated let alone um it gives you enthusiasm to be more to go the extra mile um even being here today i probably would've still been in bed but today is my daughter's party and i was trying to make whatever extra little money i could make you know to make sure that she has a good day so it's all about uh going the extra mile doing anything that you can do to provide <pro> to provide for them but it it's a very hard job um that moment of the day when your child tells you how much they care about you and um my daughter her favorite thing is to tell me i'm her i'm her heart you know and and how many i mean just call your name it just it's a sense of reality um to be called mom or to call call dad and it it just like it infatuates you it also let you know like this is reality this is this is my life this is what i'm living right now and it's a it's a very good feeling that's the best part of being a parent thank you um a lot of different things i'm actually taking care of my daughter <laughter> um i'm here with her uh i was raised by my grandparents so i mean i didn't really i didn't get to know my mom til i was sixteen and my father i mean i couldn't point him out on the street on the sidewalk so i don't know who he is so i feel that um i'm very different from them because no matter how hard the job is getting i don't give up yeah um i guess i there's been <yawning> oh excuse me um there's been a lot of different people that have been very positive in my life i can say um my sister she was a good influence on me to get into the medical field she's in the uh she's an l_v_a and um she's one of my older sisters um i can say me believing in god being in my life god being in my life has also kept my strong and to know that i don't have to take on this world by myself because god is there for me and um hm i don't know i don't really look up to a lot of different people because people lie so and that's the most what i could think that's been positive for me i think i'm outgoing <laughter> i used to be shy um coming up as a kid and i don't know i don't know what happened to me uh one day i just broke out of my shell and i've been um very accurate of showing my personality off <laughter> um i actually like for the waves to collapse against the rocks at the beach and i like to just sit there and just zone out everybody else that's there and rub my toes in the sand and that is so relaxing um <yawning> excuse me sorry about that um i learned not to uh 'cause it's a form of it's a form of knowing who's in control and is it your life or someone else's and i feel that my temper me controlling my temper is showing that i'm in charge of my life so i don't even let stuff get to me i don't even really remember the last time that i had to control my temper because that's how much i try to block out the  the negativity mm probably my husband <yawning> my daughter's father um uh probably over like uh you know the dishes or like the small things but not uh physical altercation like with another human being no wow um being honest i kind of feel guilty about how things like uh basically how things ended um before my mom passed i wish that i could've helped her a little more even though people tell me not to feel bad um because she wasn't really there for me growing up but i kind of feel guilty like you know not being there as much as i could've been for her before she passed away so i think that's something that i um i still feel guilty for um going through my mom passing away um i felt like <clearing throat> i felt like um basically that it was i felt kind of robbed in a sense like i felt everyone else had parents and i grew up with my grandparents and then for me to go so many years without actual you know mom and dad for me to get eighteen years old and then then she leaves me it was kind of like um i don't know it was nerve wracking because i felt robbed you know it was like i didn't have her all these years and then now that i'm older and i'm i don't even have her now so um signing the paper of having a c section when it was time for me to have my daughter i was so nervous so scared um really didn't know what to do how to take it and i mean like that was so scary um it was the safest way of bringing my daughter into this world yes it's hard <laughter> i didn't even sleep last night that's why i'm yawning <yarning> but um uh i i kind of tend to try to do everything and i have to get back to that stage where i have to think about myself as well and give myself time um a little like this but actually i'm a little nicer today <laughter> um just groggy um <yawning> lately i've been feeling very confident about um being positive about going the extra mile of being a good parent uh <yawning> yeah i actually really don't care what other people think anymore i used to let that bother me but i don't no more no no um uh today 'cause i was so happy that i brought <brung> my daughter into this world today on her birthday um getting to know people mhm mm not at the moment if i go uh to watch who i associate with my weight <laughter> uh i would say my grandma mm um uh uh it's it's just uh i'd rather not um my daughter that's my pride and joy wow thank you bye,1
<sync> sure pretty good new york uh i moved to l_a in the seventies but i yeah but i lived a lot of different places of um i guess every few years but i travel a lot so i've lived in i've lived in africa i've lived in spain switzerland hong kong too um different cultures food music rituals uh everything the smells the colors makes you feel alive excuse me one of my trips uh i lived in kenya for about a year um i'd say i love horseback riding so when you're uh viewing other animals when you're kind of disguised in the scent of a horse you can approach the animals a lot closer so um it was great seeing red orange fall sunsets and riding along you know uh seeing so many animals yeah in kenya um probably when i went to a a masai village and i happened to i used to live in hawaii and i've had been to tahiti and i was wearing one of those pareos that are hand painted and i had it tied over the left shoulder with the twisted in a knot and i happened to enter a masai village for the first time uh that day and i looked all around and the men were wearing their clothing exactly with the same twist <laughter> on the same shoulder and they came over to me and they said why are you dressed masai and uh <laughter> and um then they came back and gave me what appeared to be uh some very large what looked like beaded leather bookmarks but they were actually earrings so they would've like weighed my ears straight down and um and then then they gave me some bracelets and then they had uh me wear something around my waist and they said now you look proper masai <laughter> so but i i yeah i just i have a lot of uh i think living getting a chance to live in different countries around the world i've just uh you feel alive all your senses are completely you know uh awoken yeah <sigh> i think it's not so clear cut i think a lot of peoples are a hybrid of both i mean i think i can be extremely shy sometimes but extremely brazen uh and very courageous at other times probably one of my best virtues is i'm very gutsy person so when i really feel passionate about something i risk everything to go achieve it sometimes um i believe that um usually i well i make decisions very quickly and i find that i have a friend who makes decisions very slowly and he said to me tell me how i can make decisions quicker and i told him i said well in each case you always have no choice and he says what do you mean there's hundreds of choices and i said not really because it's gut wise is only one and it doesn't really matter you waste time physical energy emotional energy mental energy reflecting all of it when gut wise you always know what the choice what you really wanna do is and it doesn't matter whether there's a ninety eight percent chance of failure even if it's a two percent chance of success you have to go to the one that may yield you joy so i always go to that it's it's to me a waste of total time and energy to even think about another choice 'cause who cares if you remain unscathed but it when it yields no joy uh pardon you said you put your fish what do i do when i'm annoyed um <sigh> <tisk> i think when i'm annoyed sometimes i it's because sometimes i can have i can need to be a little more patient um i guess you really have to put yourself in somebody else's shoes rather than the way you would react you have to have more empathy um not really i think that's the reason why i enjoy traveling so much 'cause you're put in other situations where you're forced to to um understand other people's lives a lot more regardless of how different they are uh from yours different situations i've been to so many third world countries and and lived in so many different situations that you <y> it it helps create that which is why travel is really the best education there is <sigh> let me think um <tisk> uh <sigh> last time i argued about something um god i'm trying to remember <laughter> um oh i think it was when somebody didn't respect actually my privacy in something um uh <sigh> oh i know what it was um it was somebody who belonged to the uh uh scientology faith um i uh inherited i inherited um possibly uh a immune disorder from my mother my mother died from lupus and um uh i sometimes even right now i have like skin rashes welts and everything and i am very photo sensitive and um <tisk> i had an you know an episode where i was i had big flare up and i wasn't really feeling well i felt flushed and everything and the scientologist tells me that i needed to be audited and um and he said something about are you aware of past lives and i had told him that i was buddhist and i was kind of curious that if you're going to try to recruit somebody to convert to your religion at least you should find out the other person what religion they are just to even be informed and to be able to talk to them and i and he said that are you aware that um <tisk> about something in your past and i go yes i believe that many religions uh including buddhisms and scientology believe that things that you have <ha> have had in your history sometimes affect you or things that you keep that anger issues bitterness um resulting from even your past relationships or your parents and such can affect and make you even sick make you even have cancer yes we believe that and also <a> we also believe i said that you know that you have the power of each person has a god like or a buddha like nature to go ahead and you can make yourself even when i'm on the verge of possibly being i probably get one cold maybe every fifteen years i don't have a tendency to be sick at all and a large part of it is i think when i think i'm on the verge i take sort of like and i did this even when i was a child uh when i was seven i would fold down i had my boo boo and i would take <ta> i would say i would have the good part you know help the bad part <laughter> from a simplistic way in terms of a child and i would actually even when i was in a very severe car accident where i got cut by glass my whole back i concentrated healing and and when i went back to the hospital the doctors actually had the nurses come and say this is incredible that just <jj> her last week her back was so severely cut this is incredible healing thing so i believe that but uh um uh but i was just i think annoyed and irritated a little because the scientologist told me that because he had taken twenty or forty courses and he these certificates on his wall that he felt that he was more enlightened and it didn't <did> it wasn't even a matter i said of whether he was um whether he took twenty forty courses or whether i'd been practicing buddhism whether it was for five ten fifteen twenty years or whether somebody'd been practicing some type of christianity for fifty years and bending sitting in a church pew every day it doesn't mean this person could have never attended church and be more spiritual than somebody who has you know so i just was thinking that was the antithesis of somebody who says they're enlightened but it's just the way i guess he kept cramming his uh you know his faith down my throat that after a while i was pretty patient with him but he it was so pompous that i became irritated especially when he kept telling me that it was audited and yet the same person needed a hip surgery uh the following week and i didn't point it out to him 'cause i just didn't wanna get into it but one could say hey you have a bad hip 'cause you need to be audited that that something that you did in your past otherwise you wouldn't need to get a hip surgery i mean i believe to some extent things that can be caused by people themselves and then he's flippantly said well are you aware of scientologists believe that past lives can also affect you know and i'm thinking to myself buddhists of all religions are are kind of like well known for you know believing in in a cause and effect and past lives situations and i found my thought he should really read up if he's trying to convert other people <laughter> from other religions so but um <tisk> you know i i you know i i just didn't you know care for the fact that he wouldn't drop it <laughter> but other than that i mean i don't <sigh> um uh <sigh> sometimes to have a little more tact i guess when when it's in terms of patience i can think of that right away i guess uh disconnecting my father when he was like a vegetable in the hospital mm <sigh> mm my brother uh was supposed to be the strong one supposedly because he is in the medical field so my sister and i said well you know he's the medical one so he's probably used to seeing this all the time but it turns out he was the weakest one and even after you know my boss my father kept you know um um you know bucking the his body would actually be fighting the artificial respirator and all kinds of things you see all this jerking of body movements and stuff it was just very hard mm but you know it was after a while the uh you know even the physicians and even the uh pastor from that particular uh hospital <ho> you know hospital they said that he was no longer like even if he was to awaken from that he his brain function would've been <b> been you know negligible yeah it was mhm hm mm i don't think i really have that many things that are that traumatic that happened to me that i've had to block them i really don't know what it is within my makeup which doesn't make me feel like i need to like i don't keep i have friends that have unmitigated issues which they're not even aware of that affect their behavior or maybe their bitterness or their anger or their hatred or their fear and for some reason i i feel blessed that i don't really i can't really even think of something that i mean i've had some bad situations happen to me but it's not that the some reason they've traumatized me in affecting you know my behavior where i would where i block it that i'm not aware of something or i hold residual negativity for some reason so i really can't think of anything i mean there's bad things that happen and i know they're there but it's not like i feel like i it's necessary for me to block them 'cause i've been able to you know um accept sometimes <so> sometimes there were unfortunate things that happened pretty easy i can usually make my sleep i self sleep in any situation if i have a one hour flight to san francisco i could just kind of lean against the window with the pillow have the blanket over and even on an hour flight pass out before the plane has even taken off from the ground so i can just <j> i have literally when i've had little sleep and i very uh high energy so i don't really need that much sleep but say like if i'm in africa and i <tisk> bumpy potholed unpaved road and i suddenly saw that i need a few moments of sleep i'll just prop something up put my elbow against the window and say i think i'll gonna take a nap for <laughter> fifteen minutes go like this and through the jostling i coud just take a nap for fifteen minutes so i don't really have <ha> have that problem okay pretty okay i mean i could deal without the skin flare ups but you know from the photo sensitivity and all that but other than that i'm in pretty good spirts uh huh have i ever studied <s> studied what uh i could still couldn't hear you i'm sorry have i ever studied changes <ch> changes in my behavior what was the word um no uh uh um <sigh> i don't know just with friends and everything just even this past week just seeing friends that i enjoy being with and just having a great meal laughing just you know having a good time listening to music regret about my entire life you mean or are you talking about just recently or what are you talking about mm you know it's funny uh i find that a lot of the negative experiences that in in my life that have happened have also been uh um opened up experiences that are that are also great that i have not overlooked for example i got totally ripped off by my business partner to the tune of my whole <wh> my whole savings and i've had to start all over again and sometimes people sat to me like are you sure you're okay are you are you just pretending to be okay or are you angry do you wanna seek revenge if i was you know 'cause my business partner essentially ripped me off we knew each other's families which was even more difficult in a way um and uh he stole essentially my whole life's savings essentially in a way and he was <w> got sent to prison and the f_b_i was involved interpol was involved uh i was living in switzerland and my father was sick and i was going back and forth and um <tisk> uh but you know if i hadn't get involved hadn't <ha> hadn't gotten involved with him in business i wouldn't have had the a lot of rich experiences and i think sometimes the reason why i don't know why i'm such a positive person but for some reason uh i'm able to it's not that i'm purposely trying to i do see the positiveness in even horrible situations i wouldn't have gotten to live in barcelona and zurich i wouldn't have learned to speak as good spanish german <g> german uh lived in in europe if i had not gotten involved in business with my business partner who ended up ripping me off but and there's a lot of other experiences and different friendships that i developed during that period of time and in a way it was a total different life uh a different world that that would you know that i would've never um had the chance you know to live through if i had not involved my you know but of course it cost me financially and but then again i've always been the type of person who you know money isn't everything and i think the when i least cared about money is when i made the most of it so there you go <laughter> and for example one of my favorite times in my life probably when i lived in kenya and you would think that you know a lot of people have this really bad vision of it maybe looking living in mud dung huts or something and living very primitively i mean it it's not like that at all but i and you'd think that with the least amount of uh technological <tech> technological innovations and stuff like that i mean actually and i really didn't have you know that much many <m> many material goods at the time i mean i had the blast i had probably the one of the best years of my life when i was living in kenya the same thing that i did probably when i was about fifteen or sixteen um to live your life with passion and again like choose the way i was saying earlier about making decisions you have to make those decisions gut wise what will give you a sense of awe and wonderment what would make you give you joy and you have to it's it's regardless what the percentages are even if you only have a one percent chance of success you have to go towards that 'cause that's the only thing that will yield you know the happiness in your life <tisk> the fact that i've adhered to that and been brazen whatever you wanna say have the balls the chutzpah the cojones to go ahead and follow my passions and you know and i guess people call them sometimes strong decisions usually decisions that are easy <ea> when you where you remain unscathed usually don't yield joy that's just murphy's law that's just the way it is sure bye,0
<synch> yes that's fine i'm okay how are you <laughter> originally i'm from san francisco um originally i moved here in gosh nineteen ninety five then i went to chicago then to san francisco and then back to los angeles probably about five years ago a lotta moving <laughter> never um there just isn't anything there for me anymore uh the weather is better in l_a but the people in san francisco are nicer my husband prefers <pref> my ex-husband prefers it here that's why we moved i have an undergraduate degree in psychology and uh after that i went to law school uh when i was in college i worked at a law firm and decided that i really wanted to be a lawyer it was really interesting no now i'm a stay-at-home mom scrubbed_entry no um i love it but it is it is difficult you have to manage a life to make sure that they become a good and successful person uh <sigh> i it's easy to kinda do the academics and stuff like that you know i'm good at that the hardest thing i think is to guide them emotionally to help him through things that he's having a hard time with um feeling like i don't have all the answers um just seeing them grow and and experience new things and learn about life and the world it's just it's really really cool uh completely different <laughter> um completely different i and i am not a perfect parent but i love my son i take care of him he's the first priority in my life and they weren't like that at all um well my parents are dead i didn't speak to my dad at all before he died um i have a sister and a brother that actually i don't know where they are i don't speak to them either um probably more shy because i consider myself more reserved <laughter> <laughter> um i like to listen to music i have i listen to all sorts of music but my favorite when i'm relaxing is uh eighties music <laughter> cheesy cheesy but true um it depends on who i'm with if i'm with my son i can control my temper um if i'm with my ex-husband or other adults mm yeah <ye> yeah i don't so-so um yesterday and it was about my ex-husband dating the woman that he was cheating on when we were married um i found out he was cheating on me and i kicked him out and he told me yesterday that he's continuing to date her yeah um really angry and just really hurt um i wish that i had talked to my dad before he died i wish that i'd settled our differences before he had died the hardest decision i've ever had to make was actually ending my marriage because he was cheating on me um that would have to be well i don't know i mean i don't know if i'd want to erase anything from my memory because it makes me who i am today so i i can't really think of one event that i would want to erase uh i don't get a good night's sleep it's not easy i wake up a lot in the night i don't know i wish i knew <laughter> if i knew i i could change it i could try to do something about it but i i just don't i don't know um grumpy irritable uh grumpy irritable um down mixed with anger <sigh> it's just because of everything that i'm going through with my soon-to-be ex-husband yeah there's um i just keep it inside i mean there's nothing else to really do except <exce> i mean it is what it is so i have to deal with it no yes <deep breath> ten years ago after my son was born or nine years ago um i felt like i couldn't cope with life i was so down um i couldn't i felt like i couldn't do anything no i don't go to therapy i go to medication management but i don't <d> i don't do talk therapy i have gone to therapists and no they don't help um well some just sit and stare at you and don't say anything um you know if i wanted to talk to myself i would others give advice that i think is just it just not not good and not on point um it was probably this morning i was playing with my son just really happy i wasn't thinking about any of the other crap <sigh> um in my life i could just forget it so i was feeling really really happy ugh i think they would describe me completely different from the way i would describe me but um i think they would describe me as really sweet uh 'cause they have really sweet um confident uh outgoing because that's what i try to be to people so i think that's how they would describe me uh i wish i wasn't sad i wish i was more confident um yeah there are a lotta things i think uh it would be to not not give my life over to one particular person which is what i did with my husband i think i would spend my ideal weekend in a sunny place like palm springs with my son hanging around the pool having fun going out to dinner uh one of my two of my friends two really good girlfriends i think have been really positive influences in my life um scrubbed_entry she <sh> her life is worse than mine and uh <laughter> but we can always commiserate together scrubbed_entry is just really positive i mean she's always happy always up always looking to the bright side so that has helped me a lot my son um i went over to a friend's house and we had movie night we watched a grown-up movie and had dinner and wine and the boys were in another room watching movies and playing video games and it was just a relaxed fun evening mhm sure <laughter> bye,1
<sync> hi yes today is a wonderful day i am doing just absolutely marvelous i was born in cleveland ohio i was raised in tucson arizona and came to los angeles when i was sixteen years old yes mm uh i've only been back once since i left it's a whole another community when i was growing up i'm so glad i grew up there because it was a great sense of community which i think we don't have here in los angeles <sniffle> uh my my grandmother died and left property for my father so we came here to manage her property property uh it was pretty easy for me i was still young and it was easy to adapt so i'm pretty good at meeting people so uh that has never been a problem i traveled a lot as a child so i was used to moving and going to new places meeting new people seeing new things it's an adventure and i like the adventurous life oh one of my best trips i had it was in nineteen i'm dating myself but nineteen sixty four <sniffle> i came out here to visit my grandmother from cleveland ohio and i went to an indian reservation and i got a little note card about the reservation when i got back home i wrote to the reservation and i told them i when i came <ca> went back to school in september i would have to write uh deliver a speech rather about what i did over the summer and i told them i wanted to talk about going to the indian reservation and would they send me something and they sent me this huge kachina indian doll and that was <wa> that was a wonderful experience to have the thing is worth now if i still had it i found out like a quarter of a million dollars so <laughter> mm but that's one of the best xxx um i could be a little bit of both um i'm pretty when i have to be i can be outgoing 'cause i'm good at meeting <mee> talking to people and meeting people but sometimes i have a little bashful side a little shy side of me too so so a little bit of both i studied business administration <ad> administration with a uh emphasis in marketing and advertising um well i really i started in computer science but that was back in the day when computer science wasn't this what it is today and um i liked <li> i was good at it but it wasn't any interaction with people and i love people so i wanted something that would bring me interaction with people so i went into marketing and i was working for a t_v station where i was going to school so that fit in line in marketing advertising so no now i'm a photographer i'm a celebrity photographer i shoot a lot of stars i shoot on the red carpet i shoot a lot of special events and anything else people will pay me for <laughter> it's not hard at all it's my passion i love it it's like not working i'm in my dream job i i just need to get more jobs <j> jobs to that pay pay me well because there's a lot of times as a photographer you have to do a lot of things <thin> events for free to get known so it's a building process of relationships so i'm still in that process of building relationships so that i can get more paid jobs but this is my dream job i love what i do <laughter> well now i'm really back into it i used to do it a while then i got away from it but it's meditation i practice meditation and i try to do it twice a day in the morning and at night before i go to sleep i work with oprah and deepak chopra and anybody else who provides me with meditation and i use that to calm my body um i can generally control my temper sometimes i get set off i guess like any other human person <per> being but i work at trying to keep a moderate and temperate uh temper in personality oh wow we i argued with my daughter the other day about something i said and i did not mean to say it to hurt her but it obviously did and we argued about that what my intentions were my intentions were never to hurt her mm and maybe what i said did and that's what started the argument oh god i felt terrible because i i never intended to hurt my daughter and i never would wanna hurt her and i felt bad that she had been hurt by what i had said so i had to have to guard my words and watch my thoughts well i don't have much of a relationship with my family <f> with my brothers and sisters and mother and father my parents live far away so it's just my two daughters here with me and we have a pretty good relationship you know we try to work my my daughter's a makeup artist and i'm a photographer so we work a lot together in the industry so sometimes i think we're up on each other too close we need a little more space yeah when i say the wrong things <laughter> it's no it's never easy to be a parent it's a work in progress making the right decisions about things sometimes the love the feel the feeling of accomplishment that you were able to raise the highest creation on this planet to be a a uh wonderful and productive human being i'm not as strict as my parents were i give my kids a little more freedom to find out who they are um i'm not real religious like they do but i am very spiritual um so i brought them up different from me on the religious tip and um i'm more i listen more to them i think than what my parents did it was you were to be seen and not heard when i was growing up and i let my kids' voice be heard one night i had a bad night that changed my life and i don't know wanna go into details i feel bad about that night <laughter> yeah i could've stayed home <laughter> wow i'm trying to think about a situation maybe the handling of how i me and my husband divorced i think i could've handled that a little differently well we we i think we really loved each other a lot and we just it was it was something that had come to a a end and the way we separated was kind of explosive and i think both of us could've handled it better but i think i played a part in in keeping a lot of drama going 'cause i was hurt that we were breaking up and kinda devastated 'cause i wanted my child to be raised with her father so i think it looking back now which is you know hindsight is twenty twenty vision i could've handled things a little better but what can you do you do the best that you can at that time if you knew better you'd do better the hardest decision i've ever had to make the hardest decision i've ever had to make was i was on my way to work as an enrollment counselor on a plane had a stroke was going to make an a connection and to get on the other plane to and then go to the hospital and a doctor was sitting behind me and he told me that i could not get on that plane because i might have another stroke that was a hard decision 'cause i was in dallas texas all by myself i did not i mean i was in there with an employee but i would be left all by myself 'cause my employees had to go on to montgomery alabama where we were headed and i had to make a decision should i stay or should i go but my life was in the balance so i made the decision to stay and go to the hospital but that was a hard one <sniffle> ugh overwhelmed i mean here i am on my way to work you know i flew to different states every week and uh to help kids get get admitted into college and here i am on my way to work and i'm on a plane and i feel this weird feeling coming over the left side of my body and i say my prayers and i go to sleep and then when i wake up to get off the plane i can't remove my luggage from the overhead compartment which i did every week so i knew something was wrong it was it was when you to your life and the whole world in your hand and you don't know what's gonna happen next so it was very disturbing very traumatic and i you know you don't know what's happening to you it's so the weirdest thing riding to the hospital in a medical ambulance that was a weird experience yeah but i'm here i you know i survived it the doctor told me nobody survives it a stroke on a plane and i survived so the universe wasn't finished with me yet you know what that's sometimes i have a little problem with it um sleeping a little bit sometimes i i get wired up <laughter> i get wired up just because i'm one of those real energetic persons and i have to finish what i set out to do and until i finish i can't go to sleep so sometimes it's hard for me to go to sleep other times i can lay down and just go but depends on what's going on in my head um i'm sluggish um probably a little on edge but i try and keep a a upbeat personality i'm a real energetic person so i try to but you know if you're tired your body is still talking to you so lately i've been feeling really well um except i've been having some problems because i have a um since i had the stroke i have nerve damage in my hand and in my face and so i just it's i thought it's been over a year since i had the stroke but i thought by now it would have gotten a little better and it hasn't but i'm so grateful to be alive that that is really minor <mi> minor compared to the bigger picture and i wasn't fortunately <for> fortunately my i didn't lose my facial structure or you know my face is not screwed up like a lot of people are i still can use my hands i still can shoot with my camera even though my left hand is is diminished in use but i can shoot with my right hand as a photographer so i can still keep doing my work um so you know i have to keep a good upbeat energy going on for me to keep for me to be successful no but i went through depression uh from being knocked unconscious five times when i was a school teacher every ball there was that you could name soccer ball baseball basketball name that ball hit me in my head and i suffered from having like sleep apnea and not being able to sleep from being hit so many times and knocked unconscious in the head so no only i don't go to therapy because um i don't i don't have any medical right now so i'm not able to get therapy they only offer that to people with medical it's hard to get it <sniffle> and then i don't i'm not working <work> yeah it sucks i'm not working right now because i'm still trying to get my disability so that i can get well 'cause i wanna be a fulfilled human being and i wanna be totally and you know the system it'll be almost two years before i go for a hearing so that's kind of depressing to think after all the years i've been working since i was sixteen and it's taking me it's been over a year it was a year i had the stroke february two thousand twelve and we are now in march of two thousand thirteen and i won't have a hearing until september two thousand thirteen just to tell me if i get the disability or not that's been very depressing for me because i'm wondering where i lived off my savings in the last year and i got put my daughter through college she finished and now she's having to take care of me and she's still looking for a job and my life is kinda up in the air right now 'cause i'm wondering what comes next and so i'm just praying for guidance <sniffle> i feel happy every day every day i wake up and i can breathe and i can see and i can walk and i can talk and i can still shoot my photograph i'm happy it's just a good thing to be in the present moment and to be alive <sniffle> mm you know what i figured like what good are regrets you can't change the past all you can do is change right here and right now so just live <li> move forward mm what advice would i give myself <sniffle> don't let anything get in your way you know keep a good personality and a energetic spirit and just keep pushing energetic talkative uh won't take no for an answer uh follow through reliable um good spirited giving loving um i'm most proud of that i have been able to find out my creative side i've been a visual artist i never took a art lesson before i taught art <sniffle> um i was in my late twenties before i even discovered that i could draw and paint um i'm a doll collector uh i'm i'm my creative side is what i'm most proud of because it's been able to help me being creative i can no matter what even when i i was still very ill from having a stroke i could still go out and just go take pictures and that was so soothing to my soul that i'm i'm i'm glad that i have a creative side and that i found it and have utilized it mhm uh huh and that's is that it bye bye bye,0

<synch> i'm cool fine new york yep eh about six months six months ago nicer pace uh photography job it's a good move mm uh i love the weather cool people relax easy to talk to uh nice environment mm crime when you go through some sections yeah i've done my share uh the ability to <sigh> capture events be a part of it be a part of exciting things like um olympics games festivals uh special shows yeah meet new people yeah which one mm canada uh it was nice uh very refreshing mm clean environment uh the people seemed very very lighthearted but you're able to do serious work i love the landscape uh i think it was riding onboard an amtrak train yeah uh liberated photography uh i think i'm doing it you know i really <re> i i really believe i'm doing it um not very difficult you know uh um not at least not for me because i think i have some natural inclination for it uh and um i connect well with people i'm more shy but i'm forced to be outgoing because i you know you can't really get anything done being shy but given a choice i'd rather be um you know a little more pulled back <laughter> uh until i you know i i i feel like just the closest a safe path to go so that kinda curtails with my spirit of adventure sometimes i think an example hmm well an example of what exactly you mean what aspect okay well example like uh traveling sometimes you wanna go to a particular place and it's uh something great happening there even though it's a great place but it's not such a cool place to go like take for instance like boston i used to go there a lot um now you know everybody i talk to is like a little bit nervous whether they should go there <laughter> you know to do you know uh um xxx you know have a great time you know i think it's because of all the disturbance that just happened kinda you know throws you off track a bit make you rethink um is that a good getaway spot still right now something like that you know mhm mm uh me i huh i take walks i call up a friend we have tea or something you know uh i think i pretty much gotten that under control mm eh uh it was probably something silly in a work situation that last about five minutes and oh pretty much haven't fought again i don't really dwell on negative things too much uh um i don't have any regrets right now mm i really can't think of anything right off the top the hardest decision i've ever had to make was uh not hiring a good friend uh for a job that you know they weren't qualified for that's hard uh because you have to explain to them that it's not the friendship you're hiring it's their competence my father uh he just uh taught me how to you know uh overcome uh difficulties when i was growing up and how important it was to not give up uh and be able to see the bright side of any situation you face because it goes away you know if you hold in there long enough and i i found that to be true so mhm um it's okay except <exce> except for some of my uh my distant siblings you know i don't see as often as i can mm yeah uh just you know when you when you travel quite a bit you just don't see people 'cause <laughter> they're not always there you know uh it's nothing like mhm yeah mhm uh well you know i'm i'm i get pretty excited if i'm working on something or developing something so i tend to overlook the time sometime but other than that you know when i when i'm out i'm out that's it well uh i guess i'll be a little bit uh uh try and figure out how i'm gonna get sleep you know as soon as i can to make up xxx but um uh i i try not to be uh grumpy or anything i just probably feel a little bit tired mm i feel okay now uh changes like what mm well i i i see a more hopeful future you know and i see uh i see a lot of new things unfolding i mean from that perspective yes no never uh i feel okay now uh i went to a great party last week that was really cool yeah well it was like on a rooftop uh and a a lot to really uh nice people who are basically in the same kind of uh mindset uh pursuing the same type of uh uh goals and it was uh quite inspiring actually and i got a lot of information and a lot of good connections were made mm awesome guy awesome absolutely awesome my ideal weekend is uh cooking my own food relaxing you know and if i'm in the mood for company you know i have friends and uh you know uh family members join me well i'd kinda like to put on more weight sometime but that doesn't seem to work i eat like crazy and nothing happen mm well you know i i think people in general sometime uh uh misread <mis> misread you you know if you kinda like uh if you look different or you're in <i> in a different type of a if a different set of things make you uh excited or you're into a different way of thinking um people tend to misjudge you you know and that used to make make me really be upset sometime but um yeah i'm i've kinda figured it out and i'm pretty much over that you know so i see it as their loss and not mine you know if they didn't get to know me you know that's hey maybe they don't need to and it doesn't really bother me i've kinda worked those things out in time you know yeah uh my best qualities probably um uh listening i think <mumbling> and uh maybe just uh talking uh you know on a conversational level uh yeah sometime people tend to burden me with everything they got because of that but uh you know i guess is that's probably one of the things that come with the turf so when i <clears throat> when i see too much of that i just uh pull back uh uh go for your dream believe in what you're doing don't let anyone discourage you and you'll be okay and that's the way i feel now that it's uh kind of evolved itself most proud of um i think my um my my my kinda spiritual relationship you know and my my my settleness about not being too too anxious about about <bout> things that go on around me and being able to see that you know there are no mistakes that really happen and you shouldn't really uh never allow yourself to be defeated i'm i'm proud to be able to have arrived at that point in my my my thinking my framework uh that i think that saved me a lot of uh problems that could've been uh differently <mumbles> very good questions uh i bye bye,0
<synch> yes okay um santiago chile mm permanently in nineteen seventy seven mm about every three to four years it's similar uh my parents moved here very easy mm the variety the culture um uh the

emails or i watch movies comme ci comme ca sometimes i'm really good for the most part but there are times um when i'm feeling very stressed and i have uh temper outburst uh anger outbursts i don't know <sigh> about  um maybe um thirty days ago and it was about my inadequate parenting skills xxx um ashamed angry confused but uh um i also felt like i needed to uh have my perspective understood i have four kids three boys and one girl scrubbed_entry uh my oldest son is uh living in mar vista and he's doing some menial job um he's creative and artistic and has a really good heart um my uh third son is <i> my second son <s> uh son 'cause he's my third child um lives in alabama he has a daughter and he also has a menial job um uh but he moved there to be with his daughter he's not together with his uh daughter's mother and um he's funny and really smart and um <sigh> wickedly clever and my uh third son my youngest is living in los angeles is living on his own um working at a menial job is kind of finding himself he's extremely kind and sensitive and caring and loving um but he tends to be uh pretty hard on himself um and has a lot of opinions about a lot of things mm i love being a parent but being a parent isn't easy um the unconditional love you feel for your children tolerating um their shortcomings and their suffering and feeling like regret for not having done a better job um i think i tell my children that i love them and that i'm proud of them and that um i have a much more open communication and uh i'm more accepting of the choices uh that they make even though i might not agree with them i'm uh close to my sisters um i'm pretty distant from my mother um i was close when i was younger to my father but he passed away when i was twenty five my college professors um i think that they uh uh helped me perceive a different perspective on uh human beings um made me more altruistic and more um open and less judgment judgmental being poor and unsuccessful <deep breath> mm i think i could've made um better choices eh regarding the fathers of of my children and <a> and or stepfathers maybe xxx <sigh> when um i uh i left my kids um my first marriage i uh i was really uh immature and unknowledgeable and felt that i um couldn't provide for my children so i made a choice to leave them with their father for a period of time um and that was a regret and then when um i was thirty six i was diagnosed with cancer and um i had to make the choice of again uh leaving my kids with their perspective fathers and um uh until i got better i wasn't able to um be a full-time mother yeah it was separation from my kids is really hard separation from my kids is really hard um i feel ashamed and guilt and remorse because had i had a more um stable uh uh financial um hmm uh uh financial and emotional and psychological foundation i might have had the ability to not have caused them um some of the problems that they have today mm sometimes good i have to be really tired um sometimes not so good mm ineffective mm ineffective <deep breath> <sigh> i think i'm making more of a conscientious effort to um get organized and uh um take some um steps to uh physical health um well-being um getting out more forcing myself to uh participate in life more no yes um originally i think i was diagnosed in nineteen eighty maybe before that but it was never a formal diagnosis um i tried to commit suicide yes sometimes um i uh i'm no longer uh truly suicidal mm i don't know two thousand six two thousand seven <deep breath> <sigh> went to the beach for a walk with my dog i have a great ability to empathize i am open to learning um i crave learning i'm um socially empathetic i love my children um i'm a good friend mm well my depression is one thing um um i wish i was more intelligent that school was easier for me um i wish i didn't have uh such low self-esteem um i wish i could be more motivated in participating in areas that i'm interested in yeah go to college my children goodbye,0
<synch> yes i'm doing pretty good i was born and raised right here in los angeles <sigh> um the weather um would be number one i also like the diverse uh cultures i like the fact that there's a lot of different things here you can do and there's a lot of opportunity here um not just for myself but for my kids and um i think it's really a great place to be when you're trying to establish a career go to school um learn about different people the traffic the cost of living um sometimes i think it's too big and i think the transportation system as far as the bus and trains um is long overdue they need to revamp it or you know add more buses and things like that just make it easier for people to get around on public transportation i travel when i can a little bit here and there i have not been overseas yet which is a goal of mine within the next couple of years so i've just traveled domestically i try to take at least one trip a year somewhere i just like the fact of getting on the plane and going places um going particularly somewhere i've never been and learning about that place you know like so if i'm going to d_c i really look forward to it 'cause it's a historic city you know things like that um my most recent trip would've been d_c <laughter> last year um i went to go visit a friend and i stayed about three <thr> i think three to four days and i got to see the capitol um he showed me around showed me all the you know historic landmarks and sites the white house the capitol building um i got to see a lot of other different uh government buildings and um it was it was a a good experience the irony was i had to fly on nine eleven and so that had me a little uneasy but once i was in the plane up in the air i was okay and it was all good and once i was back home i was like yes but i i i miss the trip and i look forward to going back um attending uh my friend's wedding she had a destination wedding in hawaii um actually maui that was actually two three three years ago three years ago in august and um i've been trying to get back ever since and i wanna take my kids and i just love it there and i actually kinda look forward to to moving there one day um i have three sons um thirteen-year-old twins boys and my youngest is also a boy he's eight they um all have birthdays in june the twins are june ninth and my baby is june fourth and so they're just a few days apart but five years apart technically and they're just super super typical boys active all over the place hormones puberty um so it's actually an interesting time because you know the the two older boys are going through puberty um they're teenage years um my youngest um still trying to figure some things out for himself you know doing that transition stage of eight to nine years old so he'll be nine in june and then my oldest will be fourteen so it's a challenging time for me as well just the joy of watching what you put into being a parent every day and seeing how just with love and nurturing and um the right and you know well i can't say proper development but just with you know love and nurturing how a um baby grows into a toddler into you know a young boy to a teenager and then into a young man and so that experience alone has been rewarding just watching my sons grow up and go through these different stages and seeing how they have developed and you know seeing some of the things that they're going through now that so reminiscent of my teenage years and um it's just it's very rewarding and um actually i look forward to maybe even being a foster parent later down the line when they're older and off in college 'cause i really love children and giving back um mm there's probably a couple of things but i would just say um for me being a single parent is um the financial um well i would say that along with some of the emotional with <w> with them having um to bear the brunt of the responsibility of just child child rearing um you know the just the everyday things of what you have to deal with the uh sometimes when you're just tired you don't wanna be bothered or you're trying to do things for yourself you have to be reminded that oh okay i gotta cook or i have to go pick my son up or i have to take him to baseball practice uh this one want to go over here um this one is acting moody and you know just those those types of challenges um as well as the financial and you know making sure you know you're able to put food on the table you're paying your rent and you know you're keeping up with the day to day and that's those two are probably the hardest things um for me to deal with well i just um i take it day by day i just put one foot in front of the other and um i'm extremely spiritual so i just rely on god and pray a lot and meditate um if i see i need a little help if if you know i'm i'm i'm not above asking for help so sometimes if i have to reach out to people or you know see what other resources are out there to help me you know i try to do that and so for me right now my biggest challenge is just trying to go back to school to put myself in a better um economic situation so i can continue to provide for them comfortably um i studied communications actually i was a um journalism public relations major with a minor in sociology and now i'm studying business <laughter> i just thought that you know um there would be more opportunities for me with business um as far as jobs and then i you know have a desire to go to graduate school so i just figured in the long run it was a better um it would put me in a better position give me more opportunities um with the communications it's a little limited and especially as you get older um the fields of t_v reporting and things like that um are kinda become you know harder to obtain so i just thought eh i would go into something more realistic and um you know but uh i like both fields i really do i like communicating writing reading talking as you can tell and um so we'll see um <laughter> a couple probably but i would say ultimately would be traveling like working as like a travel writer um going to different destinations um trying different foods out um writing about different people cultures um learning and living you know uh about those different people and cultures living <l> living amongst <am> amongst the you know the the people there and um being interactive with the children and stuff like that so i kinda hope to be able to do that one day but yes um it it would be something along those lines and then the fallback would be a counselor social worker something in that area if i could encompass all three hopefully i can i i would like to do that um that's actually a hard question probably because i initially grew up very shy and um not so much shy as i am reserved now um but not conservative but just reserved and you know when i go somewhere i'm checking everything everybody else out and then once i become comfortable or acclimate to the situation then i'm like okay you know i warm up to the to the situation or the people but i'm also friendly i can be very friendly and outgoing i like to talk um you know i seem like a chatterbox but i'm not really so usually if i'm in a big space with a whole lot of people i don't like to be the center of attention <atten> attention i can attach myself to one or two people and you know become friendly with them but i i overall i am a open friendly person <laughter> um for me um it it could be something as simple as just unplugging everything all electronics and just sitting for a few moments meditating praying or reading a good spiritual scripture um if i'm able to i like to go for a good massage maybe get a facial um you know things that will i kinda like the physical part part of it i like massages things that really release tension um and if not then just like i said just sitting at home reading and praying or i like the beach i love the beach so sometimes i drive and go sit by the beach i like <li> also like to just maybe go and have lunch by myself or get a mani pedi or maybe go window shopping you know things like that mm pretty good sometimes i'm just like grr i don't really have so much a issue with the temper as i am i just i'm more impatient unfortunately a lot of times with people and you know situations so i just can become really irritated or irritable um quite agitated especially if it's that time of the month for me i just lose patience um outside of that i'm actually pretty good i try to be very you know conscious of where i'm at and be very patient with people especially if i could see that the person is like if if they're a new <n> a new checkout person at the the counter or cashier i do try to be i do try to be patient and understanding 'cause i would want that you know if it were me i would want someone to extend that to me um you know with my kids sometimes you know it's this it works both ways too once it's that time of the month i'm just like ugh just leave me alone um or i might have a short temper or a short fuse so i am conscious of it i try to be aware of it and and try to monitor it but you know like anybody i'm human and there are times or i have my days or moments when i could just like ugh go off and just lose it um <sigh> well i haven't really had it not per se an argument but there's been a ongoing thing with american express so i would say because it was not a personal contact but a company i eh we it it really was an argument but uh you know i i had some um issues with american express i had to call in about on i think saturday and i kept um i wasn't getting the response i expected and so i would get the whole contact the call was just back and forth very frustrating and i was upset and you know the rep was trying to overtalk me then i was trying to overtalk her so you <y> you know i don't know if you would consider that an argument but i would definitely say that's the last time when you know i just kinda like reached my boiling point to say the least and was really upset and eh that <th> that was the closest you know to an argument and then i had to call back this morning that one didn't really escalate to an argument but it was um a a a tense exchange for a minute or two probably the most recent contact and that would've been the one on saturday with american express um or actually it was on sunday yeah and um i know the person was trying to help me but you know when you you're constantly being told different things and i've had to call in about five or six times about the same situation and it not be resolved it just takes you there so um just i kept raising my voice said some things i shouldn't had um and just was more so allowed myself to lose control of the contact i like to really feel in control of the contact and so um it just took me there my blood pressure was raised <clears throat> excuse me and that was just a kind of a mess for a while for like maybe thirty minutes or an hour after that just irritable and agitated and upset and and so i always try to you know go back and pull from those and you know do my own sense of feedback and see how i could you know handle things differently but that's one i i definitely wish i could've kept my cool and been more level-headed and and not really raised my voice and you know um been more polite <sigh> mm well i've probably have had a couple but <clears throat> probably the most is a situation years ago when i just had my sons and they probably my twins they were probably about two and i was in a situation with their father again and became pregnant and um it just was not a good time and he pretty much you know was not comfortable with me having another child at the time and um i wasn't comfortable with having another child either but wanted to keep the baby but he put me under so much stress and you know kind of i wanna say really pushed me into having terminating the the pregnancy and that's always stayed with me and i've always missed that pregnancy that child i think about that that baby or what could've been i try not to hold any um anger or resentment towards him or anybody about it but i know deep down inside secretly if i had it to do all over again i would've just i would've kept the baby and moved forward so that would've been probably the hardest especially emotionally i could deal with a lot and i have dealt with a lot you know um being unemployed or you know lot of financial problems but that to me was the hardest thank you no mm mm no um okay you know um i was laid off in december so i've been constantly trying to do things to you know get um back on my feet so that's been a little tough i've had i've had to face a lot of challenges and dealing with that and issues with child support and trying to find another job and going back to school so i my <m> my range of emotions have just have been just that a range and a very good friend of mine now who we both started off you know in the same place um about five years ago well she's been able to move forward and um go on with her life and now she's graduating in next month from u_s_c with her master's in social work so i'm feeling a little envious of that and i have been for like the past year but more so recently although i've very very happy for her you know and she's a good person and she deserves it but xxx of course deep down inside i wish it was me so that too has kinda been bothering me well i'm really good with um people i communicate well i like to talk i'm really good with children that's why i would like to teach or be a counselor um although i haven't not really tapped into it i know i'm a very creative person um i know i write pretty good um i could possibly be a creative writer but i know i'm very creative so if given the opportunity i know i could tap into that and really develop those skills something like with maybe songwriting um fiction writing um but probably like interior decorating anything artistic just anything 'cause i love music i love the arts i love drama i love plays um i'm not a big fashion buff but i do love fashion and makeup and stuff like that so um i think those would are are my strong points as well as just getting along with people i know i would make a great counselor people my friends come to me all the time i have a good ear for listening i'm a great mediator and i know how to because i've been through a lot and one of my friends called me the voice of reason the one that's actually graduating from s_c but um i know i'm like light years ahead of a lot of people when it comes to insight and wisdom and i don't know if it has to do with you know having older parents myself or how i grew up or i had i had very traditional southern parents um who instilled a lot of great values in me or if it has anything to do with my astrological sign i'm a pisces but um i'm i'm really good with people just you know period you know like i said i have my moments but i i know if it if it's something i could go into and develop i would do well mm not really some of the situations um i wish i would've waited to maybe have gotten married before i had children um picked a different partner um and i say that i mean my son's father is great but um a great father for my kids but not so much as a partner for me we're not together we haven't been together in years but i'm just saying overall i think um had i yeah i think i would say if i could let me backtrack that say not finishing school when i should have and not following my my dreams and goals and doing things as i kinda was planning initially and i think that's that would i honestly be the one thing i could say i regret is not following my goals and and finishing school on time and and pursuing what i really wanted to do stay focused and finish school and pick a career path and stay on that and stay motivated and don't let anything or anybody deter you mm um i think i'm pretty stable and consistent just with overall i think um how i face adversity how i face <f> i face things you know um i am a pretty committed person i try to you know if i say imma do something i try to stick to it i'm a very loyal friend um and um i'm proud of the fact that i've i've maintained and done a pretty good job with raising my kids solo okay great thank you bye bye,0
<sync> sure in a day uh pretty well except for drab weather originally i'm from detroit michigan yes uh back in the eighties yeah uh it's been a while the last time uh it's been about five years <laughter> uh not even close uh <sigh> more setback uh out here it's you know you have the weather that's that's that's prominent <pr> prominent reason for coming is the weather it does uh well maybe better opportunities uh and the weather <laughter> yes <sigh> it took a minute uh had to adjust to <tisk> the uh different attitudes of the people the surroundings the locations and the vast area that someone had to cover to get to one spot to another um well the weather uh for one the never end uh uh uh it never snows in in southern california uh two uh the prospects of uh uh starting out a business or becoming uh self-employed and doing what i like to do the people they're not friendly for no no one's friendly out here you know uh back east and i'm from uh i was raised in the south where everybody is uh cordial friendly hi when you pass in the streets out here people think that you have uh uh some agenda just for saying hello in passing so that's what i don't like about l_a used to uh i used to be on the road a lot i was a a truck driver and plus uh a entertainment uh coach driver for several uh motown bands back in the day so yeah so i'm used to traveling yes yeah well this is a beautiful <beau> this is actually a beautiful country so just viewing uh uh the countryside uh visiting different towns different cultures uh different towns uh and seeing how basically how the rest of the uh the country uh uh lives uh some not so good some bad uh and some good um let's see denver colorado i lived in denver for a couple years which is uh really a great uh uh city uh and then i lived in uh atlanta which is uh uh really a great state where is you know you have the southern attitude <a> a southern attitude southern attitude which is everybody's friendly and gets along and and let's see i've been back and forth across this country at least sixteen to twenty times so yeah it's it's been it's been it's been an adventure <laughter> uh arkansas little rock where i had to get into a uh you might wanna say a a altercation with the rednecks down there because as as you know um i'm african american and down there they're very prejudiced you know they're the uh uh southern uh uh uh which what were the rebels uh not rebels but uh what were they uh confederates they still have this uh uh tendency of thinking blacks or any other culture besides whites aren't uh valuable people yeah so it i had a incident down there where it actually turned into a shoot out but i'm okay a little of both it it depends on it depends on the time on the period it depends on what mood i'm in at the time you know i can be outgoing 'cause i do uh like to go to  nightclubs and listen to live music live bands and i know like i said i uh i did some entertainment before so at clubs i'm more outgoing in social events more shy <laughter> meditate very good very good because uh if i let my temper get the best of me i uh tend to um cause more harm than good you know uh harm to the person harm to myself by you know uh physical altercations or um going to jail and so yeah i'm very good at uh controlling my emotions my temper good question uh okay girlfriend <laughter> uh we just recently broke up about two three weeks ago because of a argument about what she thought she could do and what i know she couldn't do and she wanted to do it anyway so uh that led to a argument and the argument ended in us breaking up so yeah it was emotional uh but um i'm fifty five and it's not my first break up so i just take it in stride and and move on uh well it's it's probably it's no one no no situation actually can be i feel uh at the time when you when you deal with a situation at any particular time there's probably always a better way to handle it after the fact but uh i would say back in the day back in the eighties when me and my  wife broke up i think i could've handled that one better because i was younger more hot tempered and more irrational so i could've handled that one better yes what the uh uh the way i broke the way i handled that situation well like i said uh being young and and inexperienced and and emotions and and attitudes and uh not being able to communicate with another person on the level of of understanding <laughter> hmm leaving home well it was like <sigh> what can i say it was about one o'clock two o'clock in the morning and i just decided to pack up and and and leave  uh without letting anyone know that i was leaving that was like one of the hardest decisions i've had to make sketchy loving but sketchy uh my family's in detroit and atlanta georgia i'm in california l_a i have no one out here so uh i'm basically on my own and i've been on my own for a long time so uh we communiate and we talk and send christmas cards thanksgiving cards you know and in that factor but uh as far as uh family it's it's it's sketchy no one hm uh i don't know uh most things that that i don't wanna remember i don't so and i have erased a lot of things from my memory or uh placed them in a closet which i can't open anymore to to remember that so but the most thing that i can say is uh uh i won't go into detail on it but a incident where it caused great bodily harm to a person in the last two weeks uh with the i've had uh this hearburn problem so in the last two weeks it's been really difficult for me to get uh some sleep 'cause i have a i have uh in my pocket right now i have a a jar of tums it's keeping me pretty uh sedated right now irritable um anxious um need to get things done uh and i feel like uh i have uh people and things that's against me and trying to block everything that i'm doing to succeed and that's been a great uh disturbance to me yes it is but you know like i said i take everything it with a grain of salt and i keep pushing because uh you can't stay mad or vengeful at any one person or any one thing too long because it doesn't accomplish anything so i have to keep pushing uh no basically i'm still <s> still the same i just just keep my thoughts <th> uh i keep my ideas that i need to do uh and try to accomplish uh uh what i need to uh uh accomplish post mm traumatic stress uh no uh uh yes uh back in uh oh nine two thousand nine um crying a lot uh not trusting uh suspiciousness of other people uh so what uh and i was uh recommended uh and referred to a medical uh uh um mental health uh facility for treatment off and on yes when i feel depressed and feel anxiety building up in me uh yes i still have treatment yes because i get a chance to express uh some of the things that i normally don't express and i can i can like blow off steam or uh blow off the anxiety part of uh my depression hmm well i don't know uh really really happy um oh when uh well i was really really happy when my uh the girl that i just broke up with came from upstate for us to be together that's when i was really really happy and then that turned around within two weeks but at that point in time when that happened i was really really happy witty um <laughter> witty um informative <inf> informative um um social uh i basically everybody say i need i should've became a counselor because i'm very enlightened in a lot of life's uh problems so uh my friends would describe me as helpful probably education more education not raising my sons well uh my son my my sons were young in age when me and my wife broke up out here and she moved and remarried and she has the she has the boys with her and they took on the new husband's name and i wasn't able to raise them like i would've wanted them raised patience more

situation as it was and not really xxx wanting to deal with it sort of like fuck you <laughter> no it was good oh my gosh um the sale of my business i wish i would've handled that differently um i didn't have to really sell the business but i got scared and i sold it and i could've handled it in a much different way fear um i was afraid of mounting debts i was afraid of the economy wasn't good this two thousand seven two thousand eight i was um not thinking clearly i was afraid of uh mounting debts i was afraid of um being sued by employees i was afraid of uh yeah not having enough money i was afraid to be embarrassed i was embarrassed you know for running out of money um <sigh> yeah i would've handled that much different knowing what i know today it was yes i could've i could have downsized i could have downsized sold cars got rid of cars uh i could've cut hours i could have reduced my expenses and sat tight with it and not and just worked through it and not have reacted out of

that wow positive <posi> my father was a positive influence he was a really genuine man honest uh funny um handsome um i have a business owner a business man that i worked for who was a extremely positive influence at least in my professional life um i've had uh a counselor at u_c_l_a who was um totally i think of her often and some of the little things that she'd said to me keep me going um <sigh> in my life now trust the process she told me to trust the process and when people are having trouble and i'm having trouble i take a step back and say you know just trust the process it it it all works out the way it's supposed to be mhm and there's one more positive influence that i knew in hawaii that taught me um a friend of mine that uh lives on kauai that taught me uh how to enjoy nature and taught me how to fish and and i i love her a lot a great positive influence healthy healthy influence it's not i have back problems so it's hard to sleep at night uh and i wake up in the middle of the night sort of uh stretching and um straightening out my back i have a back issue that sometimes more often than not uh keeps me from sleeping good that's okay i'm dealing with it um i'm a little depressed uh i've been a little depressed i haven't been working as much and um i um you know i have pain in the mornings and in the evening <eveni> i have pain thorughout the day in my from my with back and it uh is a little depressing you know i get depressed also um you know just thinking about my business that i sold and you know where i would've been if i hadn't have done that and a a general feeling of um i've been a little depressed over the past uh couple of years actually yes um well i've been diagnosed many many years ago and i guess depression stays with you although it gets treated um and uh i was diagnosed about two years ago uh i think i don't know it asked me that on the questionnaire as well and uh and i sought treatment for it and then uh my insurance ran out and the prescriptions uh i couldn't put uh do my prescriptions anymore but now i'm back on uh medication <med> medication and you know so i take medication for my depression therapy absolutely i love therapy wow that's huge um confidence in self uh confidence in myself um confidence in my decision-making a general feeling of overall content uh a sounding board you know when i have stuff that's bothering me that i can't go to the i i feel that i can't go to the person with i um can go to my therapist and a lot of times the issue is resolved there it wasn't a big issue or i worked through it or the therapist through the therapist allowed me to look at a different way of looking at the situation and in that way i find therapy to be invaluable actually i believe so uh yes i was i believe it was i think it was told to me by a psychiatrist that that's what i was that's what i was having and this was within the last five years i think it was looking back now what are we two thousand thirteen it was two thousand nine so four years ago not able to deal like shell shocked not able to deal with anything eh irritable on the phone uh i mean just uh just anything would get me to fly off the handle and um just uh not able just shell shocked and not and hiding at my in my house not opening mail <m> mail not being able to concentrate not being able to deal with with things that were that i felt were well that were bombarding me i felt overcomed <o> overcomed and um the psychiatrist said that it was post-traumatic stress disorder but um and i was given some medication which i stayed on for a year or so uh or so and i don't know through psychiatry and therapist and medication um i was able to come out of my shell a little bit hmm about a week ago i was on a hike eh up in malibu and uh at this beautiful labyrinth that looked over the pacific ocean and we i was with a friend and we were having lunch and i laid down on the grass and took a nap and i felt content i was happy at that moment at that moment that time about a week ago hmm honest sincere smart um caring um <sniffle> smart um <sigh> good question i'd have to think about that uh yeah i have regrets in life you know everything works out so um you know if i could change the past i would've never dropped out of school when i did a long time ago i mean i've since gone back and completed lots of stuff um i probably would've gone into the military i think i was going to do that in my early twenties i'm fifty five now um i sort of regret not doing that um at that time um i regret uh selling my business i regret and of course i can't control this but i regret that my father died when i was so young and he never really got to know me and i never really got to know him i regret uh i regret not seeing my grandmother enough before she'd passed away i regret uh i mean those are the things that i can think of right now not putting away for retirement i regret when i had the money to do it um yeah i mean just here that's what i would say stick with it just stick with it because in order to get out you have to go through and i it when it comes to fear or flight i get the fear and i flight so sometimes you just have to sit in fear and then everything works out wow i'm most proud that i <sigh> have remained genuine um i'm most proud of being who i am and being basically comfortable with that and i'm proud of that i haven't changed to the world <wor> to the world you know for the world i haven't changed i've stayed mm who i am thank you thank you bye,0

and i talk with them and they help me out a lot so i get to hear good stories mhm mm uh going in the mountains and seeing waterfalls that no one else had seen except for my people yeah that was the most beautiful thing i think i found mm mhm <laughter> um it depends on the situation if i'm um if somebody comes to me looking for me to help them i take control but if i need help it's eh i i work at asking for help so it depends on the situation mhm i garden and i paint mm i'm very good at it uh three days ago it was about communication it was uh the lack of communication on the other person's part and i needed them to communicate better so that way i could understand uh they didn't communicate so we had an argument and uh got it settled <laughter> i felt um caught off guard because this is a individual that i spend pretty much almost every minute of my day with and to not be told what was going on in this person's head and then to have a situation arise you know i was kept out i didn't like that uh mm i'd rather pass <laughter> mm uh um probably the lack of time spent with my grandparents growing up it's just when they're gone you regret that you didn't miss time with spent time with them so mm uh one thing i truly wish i could remember i i was a i was a professional athlete at one time and i had partied 'til like four in the morning and then i had did my event at like ten

people besides myself mhm uh i studied uh massage therapy and got my nursing degree um and a lot of it's just been on job education um very close uh uh due to my own injuries um i had just gone through the therapy process and believing in people and seeing how it worked and i decided to do that i wanted to help people too yeah oh yeah yeah yes i wanna paint that's all i wanna do is just paint <laughter> um i have two sons and it's time for me to uh to move on and they're older and they can take care of themselves now so me leaving the area where my sons are it's pretty hard yeah oh the reflection of you <laughter> the reflection of you reminds you so much about yourself who you are consistency even when you're sick <laughter> being consistent i don't assume my kids are right or wrong i listen to 'em first and i make my decisions after that and i try not to come from an emotional heightened place i think logically and i put myself in their place before i do it we discuss we communicate heavy in my family uh 'cause that's the only way we get along with each other is through communication so communicate um my family is severed pretty much so my family and my relationship with my family on the reservation is very tight um the rest of the family we're all fragmented and scattered around the southwest so it's not very tight at all uh i have too many to count um start with my uncle my uncle was like my dad raised me a good way uh xxx uh he watched out for me he told me he taught me hard work at a very young age um he also taught me to protect my family and taught me honor taught me love he's a good man mm i don't i haven't had a good night's sleep in years so i i have get broken sleep uh dreams the dreams become too real i get up and go to the bathroom <laughter> and go back to sleep <laughter> i try to <laughter> um <sigh> um my years of fighting it just uh it caught up to me xxx uh reserved yeah reserved and i try to find things to distract my brain i think of different ways of doing things uh mm well i got rid of t_v about eight months ago so i got rid of that distraction so what i do now is i either paint i garden or cleaning house washing dishes you know or get out and go walk that's another thing too do a lot of walking nowadays uh anxiety <anxi> anxious <sigh> uh um a lot of anxieties uh but it's good i have techniques to bring myself down now um nothing new out of the normal yes uh three years ago <sigh> around there three <sigh> insomnia issues um it was about two years ago around there two little bit over two years ago i was released from therapy oh the therapist released me um well i had i noticed is i still deal with pictures and emotions but what i do is now i've i really practice hard at taking care of myself and and getting to those places the things that strike me that get get me anxious or excited or angry i've learned how to work out of it and realize it's not real it's not real it's just the emotion it's not real so these are the things like little mantras that i tell myself and this has really helped me a lot from therapy because it taught me that those emotions and pictures truly aren't real and yeah so therapy has helped a lot i mean it's just it's changed my world yes around the same time as the p_t_s_d uh three years ago um <sigh> in my dreams when i dream i do last night i was just dreaming of fighting and then in preparing fighters to fight and that was another thing too i build up anxiety dreaming about preparing fighters to fight and then stepping in front of thousands of people and then i always end up fighting in my dreams so it's always mm what gets me scared in all my dreams is that i should've made the move and finished the fight and i didn't and so it builds anxiety and stress in me and then i tend to act out in my sleep yeah like it was real like i was there like like i smell taste feel everything there i was there yeah uh this morning <laughter> driving here talking to my girlfriend this mm trustworthy he loves me i love him he's we're best friends i have zero to change mm i can't recall regret uh just not spending time with my grandparents and and i think day to day issues maybe you know a couple here there that i should've went to the store first or something like that but i mean yeah it's nothing like that xxx quit thinking you know it all yeah my loyalty my trustworthiness mm start a new art project yesterday it was nice mm well i i we were in santa barbara and we found some rocks and yeah some old rocks that someone had made a pile of and just threw a dump of old rocks out of the way and i went through the pile of rocks and i found this old rock that was in the middle of it and i took it home and now i'm doing a art piece on it and for me it was like this thing was totally forgotten about was just considered a rock and now potentially it'll be sitting on my grandkid's table you know it's just to me that's really cool i like that mm start starting something that i'm so bad at that i don't think there's no way i can be good at it and all the sudden i get to be better at it to where i don't even have to think about it just so good at it that way i could just touch it and feel it and i don't think about it i these are the things that i'm proud of like i like that i like that accomplishment i guess you can say mm bye

<sync> yeah i'm okay uh i'm from los angeles mhm oh um the weather <laughter> the weather the weather the weather the beach the weather the beach the laid backness the driving instead of public transportation and the sporty um i really i don't know the lack of um uh uh mm i don't know there's not a lot i don't like about l_a as compared to most cities i really it's my favorite and i've lived around the world i love it i love l_a a lot <laughter> yes i've lived in paris and i've been around the world a lot um uh it's just um it's fun and it's it's it's it's it's it's a blast it's good to see new places it's good to get to um get to experience all the fantastic um sights and and <ss> and cultures um uh well i mean um uh i i tended to actually do a lot of them um i probably would do them differently i think i'm more developed as a person now i i um i lived in paris for two years so and i lived in spain for spain was fun spain it madrid is a party town and then um and then so these were all work they were all work so i was working so it was um there's a grind there you didn't really appreciate you know what was around you so much and then i mean i still um i still i love going just to you know vacation spots like hawaii and and jamaica i'm still just really a sucker for that kind of stuff um i guess madagascar was pretty much like just really bitching because it was um it was in the eighties and it was like you were seeing a lot of uh people that had never seen white people before according to the guy driving us around i might he might've been lying um but it was just it was bitching africa was pretty much the best senegal and madagascar yeah um i'm right now about to go for an early childhood education degree and then i did a little bit of paralegal but that was really just to just to get the um just to get the stipend i didn't really have any concept of what i wanna do now i really do i have i was saying to rachel actually i don't know if you guys were able to overhear i really think that um the way the school system goes right now it um it just it it turns people into into um just um just uh dog eat dog um you know i i don't like the way the people <peo> it i think it's so draining the um school system right now and i feel pretty bad for everybody so i wanna try to fix that that would be my dream job that so i'm excited that like i wanna go in a direction that i wanna go in and yeah that would be my dream job is to work with sort of getting um kids on a more um organic universal um you know uh trajectory um i think it could be done i don't think it would be done via any sort of um legislation except here and there i mean it it that always ends up for becoming you know facade and farce itself anyway but i think there are ways i've always reached kids anyway and they've always felt where i was coming from and so i think you know there are ways to sort of buck the system without even talking to the system uh i guess i'm just a combination of the two i don't think um i don't know actually i'm kinda i might even be working that out there might some outgoingness to overcompensate for what's actually shyness and vice versa so you don't know <laughter> yeah yeah yeah that's cool um i definitely um uh try to reflect and stay in a pretty lucid space as often as possible so a lot of lying down at the moment i'm in transition so there's just a lot of and i and i hang out with my dogs a lot so that's quite soothing i try not to do i don't really do anything that's too tense unless it's time for it like time to drive to a job or time to you know go make some things happen meetings and stuff but otherwise um i try to stay in a pretty relaxed space most of the time so it's not like break and but you know and i i miss <mi> i miss swimming i can't believe summer's coming so i'm gonna swim some more too um when i'm truly outraged uh it comes out and then i i'm i'm i'm hitting some kind of bad parts right now 'cause it's a very hard time i'm fighting for my child so there are times when i will just cuss up a storm just to get off some steam a little bit but usually pretty much there's always um you know someone in the periphery that gets it and and you know it's like that bumper sticker if you're not outraged you're not paying attention so usually some kind of sanity can prevail oh well i mean these are times where i just can't find somthing in the car and but when i argue with people it's been a lot of the times when i'm being flat out you know um sabotaged or or definitely just when uh what's the last specific time well i you know i lost my temper dreadfully with um unfortunately um the woman that gave me birth because that she is intrinsic in a lot of i mean she's pretty much a horrible person so i i recently lost my temper with her i felt like um i mean i like again um i think i sort of said this just now i felt in a way good because i get it you know which is as opposed to not getting it which is even worse but i guess there's another side of the bank of the thing to get to to where you can be a little more constructive about it it's like you know you get to a point where you're glad you can actually see that there's a horrible travesty going on but then you have to figure out how to deal with the horrible travesty but so i mean i don't <do> i didn't feel like shame i really honestly didn't feel shame i didn't i didn't feel there are times when i feel like it was stupid to lose my temper just because there are people that will try to use that against you that's all but i never really feel bad for being angry about what i'm angry about well when i was pregnant i wish i had um like i said um i i went through um such an awakening about realizing when i was being sort of um undermined that um that demanding my respect became a huge issue and when i was pregnant i ended up being so disrespected in the place 'cause i was being a hippie on the beach for six years so i always felt like i was being so disrespected in the place where um i was set to be when the child arrived that i stormed out via what was a good survival mode before but left me jumping out of the frying pan into the fire and they got my kid so yeah it's fucked up yeah i don't want to erase anything from my memory i like having everything consolidated and cohesive i don't and integrated i don't wanna erase anything from my memory um well did i get it right or did i get it wrong <laughter> um yeah i'm uh i guess the hardest decision was whether or not to sign um sign mediation agreement with d_c_f_s and i should've said no let's just go straight to court because the there is nothing wrong with me i just happen to succumb to an s_s_i check via bullshit with my mother and i should've just been you know um brave enough to just go in there and do that and instead i chickened out and did their mediation and they played me out overcautiousness it's horrific horrendous bourgeoise quality intrigue and sabotage it's bad it's okay someone that i mean there's been um you know there's been some some great people uh again from afar i have not sort of really um achieved a real great ability to build relationships and i'm working through that right right right <r> right now and i think that's a lot why i don't have my son but as i've grown and developed i've seen encouragement from like minded souls and you can see that and so that's wonderful and um but otherwise you know a constant you know contact with someone that's really good for me it has been hard for me to um get to that point not so easy these days at all um i'm being i've been um i'm not completely centered and then there's been some um actual you know uh people thinking it's funny to harass me or jolt me as they walk by and so there's been actual harassment and stuff like that um i'm still pretty pollyanna'd out i still forge ahead and try to be as pleasant as possible i'm tired and drained and a little bit um frustrated because that i know that um i've been sort of that i sort of have a bit of um my um energy and and space being usurped <u> usurped and i can tell and i don't know how to get through that and past it no no um there are i'm i'm i'm basically very very very happy pretty much blissed out person but um this fighting for my son has me sort of trudging areas that it's as if the same trees that were thrown in my road in childhood before i realized i was such a happy person are thrown there again so i'm going through some of the same pitfalls and mistakes but you know um during the day i'll i'll i'll i'll think something completely true and organic and i i'll just stare at something and go wow that's beautiful and i'll be reminded that i'm pretty close to my spirit so um i try to stay there twenty four seven i'm pretty spiritual that way um uh uh fun i mean if i had one that was willing to say all the nice things about me gets pretty competitive out there um that you know that i'm this is off you guys that i'm funny and that um and that um i think that's bad um that i'm funny and that i'm good and that that i'm trustworthy um just uh i'm i'm i not necessarily change but grow through um my ability to connect with the people i wanna connect with and disconnect from the people that manage to to drain me i already said i regret the thing with um leaving the place where i could've delivered my son even though i was being um uh sort of abused get the fuck away from your mother <laughter> sorry um you know and like a lot of the <th> um and and yeah and to open your eyes look what look what's going on i'm proud of my um spirit and my outlook and my um my access to um what's really going on in the world and my um awakeness i'm just proud of me as a person okay you're welcome bye,0
<sync> yeah cool i'm hanging out you know being on an adventure chilling culver city california yeah yeah all the different microcosms and different places and peoples and scenes and stuff you know

not anymore this being me and just <j> hanging out i rap that's what i do i do little shows around the country and stuff i got a little fan base and i'm just always you know just doing that just doing art i draw too my my dream job is not working a job and being me that's the dream job getting paid for being me so that's yeah i'm pretty good like two weeks ago i was at this after hours one i was already like super drunk and two it was after hours three it was after hours so like man i had a bunch of pens these dudes took my pens away <clears throat> pens in my like fanny pack i had like a fanny pack so i had pens in there 'cause i do art he's like nah dog you can't take this in and i'm like okay for sure let me just leave 'em right here and i'll get 'em when i come out and he was like okay i come out and they're gone accidentally knock a beer over and he gets mad at me he's like you gotta go now and i'm like that wasn't my fault that was your fault but then but then while that happened my homie was getting like ambushed by these three big old security guards and then you know when i saw them put hands on my friend that's when i really lost it and i and he and i was like better let go of my friend right now he's like what you gonna do ese <spanish> and i'm like what you gonna do and then like he threw me to the ground then i and and no no he had his arm over me i put my arm over him and threw him to the ground and then it got broken up but that was the last time i got angry it was cool it was fun life you know huh i made <gibberish> maybe that maybe that situation could've been handled differently it could've been handled differently if they would've been handling things differently then i wouldn't have to react it's not like i was mad i was acting off of reaction i had to react like that because like justice like i couldn't it was unjust it was like i'm not a mean person at all but when i saw one of my loved ones get attacked i had to like come and like you know like react to that and they were the hot you know what i mean i was like yo ya niggas is tripping like yo chill out this is a tiny little white dude you're a humongous ass mexican nigga it's like you need to fall back you know what i mean it was crazy <laughter> guilty uh i don't know i steal shit sometime from stores when i'm hungry if i got no money i guess i'm not really guilty 'cause i don't know actually yeah i don't feel guilty about that food should be free know what i mean but um yeah i don't know i lie i guess i lie <l> everybody lies sometime i lie sometimes maybe like little like idle here and there exaggerations okay <ok> nah nah never the hardest i guess i don't really know what the hardest decision was but i get faced with hard decisions and those would be like i got so many friends sometimes i can't really hang out with everybody in one weekend so it's like i gotta make decisions like if i go over this sector of the town i'm gonna hang out with x y z niggas if i go over here x y z niggas so it's like heavy you know those are hard decisions 'cause i never like to let anybody down so uh yeah stuff like that deciding between friends to hang out with

old lady who cooks really good and it's tight i don't know something i could erase from my memory i wouldn't wanna erase anything from my memory 'cause that'll be like because like the experiences you go through make you who you're who you are i think weak people like to wanna erase things or block things out like i don't that doesn't exist i mean there's shit that's been hard but i would never say i would not want that to happen 'cause you know you must you gotta learn from experience you know i mean to be the better you all that shit is like a is like test you know that bad experience is just a test you gotta overcome and be stronger and not just like curl up and be like oh my god life's hard oh you know that shit's for weak people i don't believe in that i have compassion for people who do get a who do wanna do stuff like that but i still like i don't see the logic in it mm i mean i stay up pretty late and do all sorts of reckless ass shit so uh but when i am home and it's pretty

people be loving me man they don't like me they love me and that shit's crazy i just you know i just try to be happy i try to make people happy and just you know <sniffle> be real posi-core as they've said like this is hella positive <p> positive you know man i really don't wish i could i mean i'd lose weight i guess that's about it but besides that i that's i mean i ride bikes every day like my legs are pretty strong maybe i'd just get more buff in the arm but that's about the only thing i would change and i don't really <r> i'm not really in a hurry to change that like if that happens just through me living and me biking more then yeah cool but i don't not <n> i'm not you know abrupt change i don't need i mean gradual change sure but i'm not i don't know yeah i wouldn't change anything but if i would it would be that but really nothing 'cause i'm chilling right now uh i don't know i got broken up with like in august that made me feel bad about myself i guess and yeah it was just somebody i was going out with but they just broke up with me and like that shit sucked but that was probably the last time like i felt really bad about myself <cough> um what exactly do you wanna know about that oh like um i don't know we were just going out and then she was just hella jealous and was going through my phone sometimes and accusing me of shit but then she ended up breaking up with me just 'cause she wanted to like mess around with other people and that was the relationship in a nutshell uh life sucks you gotta adapt and change man know what i mean don't walk from it run to what'd you say yeah that bitch gave me s_t_ds that shit sucks fucking a that's the only thing i regret yeah man it's a cold game but i i got the shot it was cool i'm like boom clean but that's about it i

twenty years ago i i was only seven years old you what do i tell my seven year old self he wouldn't be able to comprehend the advice i would give what <w> what'd you say oh oh oh yeah he wouldn't um be able to comprehend the advice i'd give him i'd be like just um fucking read a little more books or something dude like uh i don't know man fucking it's gonna be okay you're you you you're great just keep doing <ts> cool shit and have a ball i don't know i wouldn't know i wouldn't wanna alter young me actually and this is why i say this because if i would to tell my young self to do something differently i would not have grown into the person i am right now to even be able to tell my young self something if if <i> if the laws of quantum physics and all that shit is real and time travel you know anything i do in the past would this life would be now be a variable so me going back there telling him to do something differently will alter the course of history and then the time stream that i'm in may not may cease to exist you know what i'm saying so i really wouldn't wanna do that i'll just be like do fuck up fuck up more even but yeah make more mistakes 'cause the only way to to be a better person is to make hella mistakes you know at least that at least that's like my my reckless like mindstate like yo if you're gonna fuck up fuck up hard 'cause you'll learn more from it you know they say what do they say um experience is the best professor you know what i'm saying that's basically what that that's how i jive you know what i mean <sniffle> i'm proud of this life that i'm here

superficiality of people um the narcissistic attitude um uh just the um uh it it doesn't have a small town sort of feel where you know just the warmth the human sort of warmth interactively so yeah no um i have um a fear of flying and i have um i've developed agoraphobia <laughter> uh incredibly difficult um yeah i'm i'm guessing you mean the agoraphobia um more so than the fear of flying um it's uh it's more of a recent um development and um it's um eh it's progressing <pregr> progressing um to be worse uh it's very um uh what's the word um immobilizing and and very um distressing actually mhm <laughter> yes it is how to i cope with that um just uh just trying to um uh do the best i can and uh try to you know have the most courage i can in the situation and challenge myself in um small steps um i read a lot i do um bibliotherapy reading um and i try to inform myself um of the um of the professional literature um so that i could um hopefully overcome it someday mhm um yes definitely um uh certain things trigger it like um enclosed spaces um being in a car traveling um uh being away from home um being in someone else's car uh things that are outside of my uh locus of control um uh xxx actually i i don't go to school right now um my dream job is to be a psychologist <laughter> um i'm not a psychologist but what would make me decide to do that is um uh having lived um through some challenges like this um having lived through some traumas um but i've always had an interest in it um since junior high of um uh i'm very interested in people and um in human interaction and human connection and um the betterment of of uh of those things um bridging people together and helping people interpersonally through their challenges <chall> uh personal uh challenges um uh so that's that's sort of um it in a nutshell um i think i'm someone who's um i can be very outgoing um and sort of um a warm and friendly presence very um easily but i think on <o> on on the exterior um but i think i'm shy and i challenge it to do that i think at heart i'm shy um but uh but i i challenge myself completely 'cause i do love human interaction so i take those risks and and jump and those challenges uh the last time i interacted with somebody was <laughter> today if <i> if i think i'm understanding your question correctly oh no no eh i think i'm misunderstanding your question but i i interacted with rachel um i just i'm um continuously interacting with people take taking those risks uh very good um mm very good <laughter> um when was the last time i argued with somebody i actually can't remember it wasn't recent <laughter> i have to think about that i don't know yet let me think um uh i'm drawing a blank um i can only rememeber things um from when i was like twenty one <laughter> right now i can't think of anything contemporary right right now my mind is okay uh when i was younger yes um i lost um a relationship with my aunt and my uncle and my cousins um 'cause when i was twenty one i'm forty five um i um uh uh had a a disagreement with my aunt and um i said something that was uh critical of her and um she threw me out of their home and um uh let me back uh i apologized immediately and they let me back into their lives um and changed their minds um so i regret that um i'm assuming you mean um how did i feel when they asked me to um never uh be in their lives again and to leave um uh shattered soul shattered heart shattered well that that was my family that was um the the good side of my family there's um uh uh the majority of my family <fa> they were they were the the loving aspect of my family um the rest of my family is very cruel and um like very abusive um i don't have any relationship with my family at all like the since i was um uh twenty one since my aunt and uncle um uh disowned me i guess is the right word estranged yeah um gosh um i'm drawing a blank just bear with me for one second um something i could um erase um <laughter> i can't even get it to my memory um uh as an example um uh i was injured and i wish i could get uh that away from my memory yeah um i was injured in um the emergency room scrubbed_entry doing um i went in for food poisoning um i was ordered to go in um by a doctor um i had collapsed and i was ordered to go into the e_r for as i said food poisoning and i came out um injured with a neurological syndrome i was injured with a um uh what do you call it um uh intraveneous procedure um and now i have um r_s_d reflex sympathetic dystrophy and it the scene in the emergency room was um it was a an out of control scene there was a problem with the procedure and the doctor was yelling at his staff who made a mistake um eh and it was extremely excruciating um it was a a crisis and so um every time i think about the injury and it was uh disfiguring i got disabled um for <f> i uh got disabled for it uh disabled permanently um from it i was also um uh disabled from my employment for a quite amount of quite a given amount of time as well and and it i have residual um physical trauma from it and disfigurement and um severe disability <disabil> disability limited um um functionality uh with my right my i'm right-handed uh with my right hand and arm thank you i don't even know what that is um i you know i i really i apologize 'cause i can't really probably give you the uh most suitable answer um uh i'm guessing it had something to do with um  my cat um and her um her xxx urgent uh um uh what do you call it um hurt she was in intensive care veterinary care and i'm sure it had something to do with that um but other than that i would say um i had uh choosing my life path whether scrubbed_entry um and uh i was admitted um to that program or whether i was gonna go um to um art school for four years um and i had to pick a life direction but uh that's not a traumatic situation um so i i don't know how best to answer your question i can't um i have um severe nightmares <laughter> and i have um nocturnal um  uh panic attacks and i also have physical illness on top of it and i'm in excruciating pain yes yes yes uh they're triggered by the injury that i told you um they're triggered by my family um they've <th> how they've treated me what um they've said to me what they've done to me um they're triggered by um what else um my um my physical um illness um not my injury only but my physical um illness as well um so yes um i feel very ill and feel so fatigued very ill and very fatigued um when i don't sleep and get enough sleep um uh my anxiety level i believe is up and um i'm susceptible to feeling distressed um so yeah yes um three years ago um my <m> my most recent um diagnosis and in two thousand and one as well uh yes um three years ago and um when i was um twenty years old um the my background my childhood um from my family of origin um and their um uh uh you know the abuse that i um went through uh and their ultimate um uh uh what's the word um rejection of me and uh estrangement um that was the first uh reason um no i stopped six months ago <sigh> um why did i stop um i'm just taking a break <laughter> i'm gonna continue yes very much it's helped tremendously um i think it helps with anxiety it helps with um um it helps inspire um create inspiration it helps um um uh feeling connected um it helps to create um what i ultimately um my goal is to um give myself a voice and um um uh it helps to to do <d> to uh it <i> it's part of that process um it also helps um to understand myself um to learn about myself um and eh there's just so many benefits it's i i'll stop right there there's many more mhm um the last time i felt really happy it was a was a really long time ago um it was before my illness um and it was in nineteen ninety seven um the onset of my illness was in july of ninety seven so it was um before that <laughter> yes um i was um in a very good place um in terms of my career um um in terms of um uh my just my relationships and um everything was just sort of at it's best um uh career relationships um personal um uh fulfillment um sort of um as well um i was very active and and doing uh very many things that were meaningful to um build a life um and i was um in the process of um uh just in the in <i> in the planning stages of my life but also very accomplished at at the same time so it was just things were just going very well and um i just really liked uh the just where my life was at it was just in a really good place in many ways mhm um i wish i could change about myself um my anxiety um i wish i could change about myself um my agoraphobia my p_t_s_d um meaning my trauma um and um uh what else um um my insecurity uh as far as um uh just um with <w> with other people in the sense that i'm always trying to make sure that um that i don't do something that that um hold on one second i'm just trying to make sure that um i don't do anything that's um offensive to them or insults them um or uh is disrespectful um and i i feel like i'm overly um cautious about that and um it it it kinda becomes um an anxiety unto itself um so i i definitely think that that would be beneficial uh to change um the other thing i'd like to change about myself is i wish i could feel um and also depression i'd like to change that about myself i wish i could feel better um i wish i didn't feel um uh so um uh i didn't wish i didn't have the burden that i do of um my family um of not having one um and uh what else um i wish i didn't have my illness and the physical um excruciating pain that i'm in uh so those are some things um and i also wish that um and this is um a a by-product of p_t_s_d i wish that i didn't have um uh the the symptomology of p_t_s_d um 'cause that definitely um affects one's complete <com> complete the complete life like eh a lot their affects their life uh completely um and i i wish i was more articulate and i wish i was um someone who was well-spoken and someone who is well-written um but there's many there's many more um uh things that i wish i could change about myself to improve myself so many more <sigh> um i'm not sure uh <sniffle> maybe to um not be so trusting um i trusted um i trusted some medical professionals that um you know again created the injury and um you know were there's a uh what's the word there's an expectation and a sort of a demand to just blindly trust um the medical profession um and <sniffle> um don't ask questions and just sort of um you know and if and not to trust your own self your own um your own instincts um or intuition um and so i would i would've told myself to be a little more careful um i guess if that's useful to your question <sniffle> um what did i really enjoy um you know i can't think of anything specific um but um i know it would have to do um with either reading or um connecting with someone on a meaningful level <sniffle> i'm most proud of um my compassion um my um my uh empathy and caring about people um despite um i mean i'm proud of it anyways but um also particularly <sniffle> um i come from a um an environment that's the opposite um a background and um i wasn't taught that <sniffle> um but i really do care about people and um i'm i guess i'm most proud of that i'm also proud of my um career accomplishments um and my um tenacity um my fierce <fie> my fierce tenacity to succeed um <sniffle> and uh you know just um also to get um the strength it takes to get through um the injury uh to live with it and to live with the illness um that i live with the physical illness um so i i think that would be it <sniffle> yes okay you're welcome bye,0
<synch> yeah i'm okay with it uh i feel i feel pretty good little <l> little nervous because i've never done anything like this before that's why <laughter> yeah from ohio cincinnati yeah uh two months ago two and a half months uh was just looking for just wanted to be in a new environment oh yeah i'm ecstatic very happy uh it took a few weeks just to get adjusted 'cause i didn't know anyone <an> the weather is probably the best thing yeah and uh i mean other than that it's pretty much the same as everywhere else i've been there's nothing i don't really <real> really like about l_a it's just you know just the weather is the best part of it yeah uh i like to travel somewhat uh i haven't traveled a lot in my life but over the past uh year and a half i've done done quite a bit of traveling just seeing different places different people new people new faces new places uh <sigh> let's see last well last summer i spent the uh summer in cleveland <sniffle> doing uh urban farming uh in the city yeah and uh i stayed at a hostel the first hostel in cleveland scrubbed_entry and i was uh doing a program with the uh scrubbed_entry and it was basically we would go to different urban farms throughout the city and volunteer about <bout> twenty twenty five hours a week so yeah really a spur of the moment type of thing um wanted to try something different something i'd never done before and farming is one of those things that you know most people would never try 'cause of a you know 'cause of a certain stigma that comes along with it uh and you know i just thought it would be fun and interesting to do something like that yeah what in the uh uh mm urban farming or in general in urban farming uh i don't know i guess uh i don't know just just the overall experience just going you know eating uh going to the farmers markets and eating all the fresh food and just seeing the difference in you know how fresh natural food taste eh you know as opposed to the food you buy in a grocery store yeah yeah it is really is uh i was i took two semesters of uh college and i was undecided so i was just taking general classes my dream job huh i guess my dream job would to be <ss> anything that involves <invol> uh i don't have like a specific dream job but anything that involves nature just being outside uh i would like to uh i wouldn't mind being like a like a forest ranger or something like that just as long as i you know yeah consider myself more shy uh i don't i don't know why <laughter> it's just the way it is uh huh i read um listen to music uh i draw watch movies stuff like that yeah i think i'm pretty good at it i think <thi> yeah <deep breath> wow uh yeah i can't remember the last time i had an argument with someone i don't know <sigh> <makes sounds with mouth> again i don't know because i don't dwell on things that happened in the past yeah <laughter> mm maybe whether or not to come to california i guess that was a hard decision well i don't know i've been thinking about it you know moving to a new place for a long time and <sigh> i guess the hardest part of the decision was thinking whether whether or not i would be secure or not you know what i mean um just going to a new place where you don't know anyone uh it's kinda uh you really don't know what's gonna happen so uh there was a lot of uh you know fear in that in that decision of should i go to a place where i don't know anyone i don't i'm not familiar with the area you know only only perception ever had <ha> that i have of this area is you know what i've seen on in media media and t_v so you know eh yeah guess that was hardest hardest decision <deci> decision that i can think of yeah eh guess so uh nothing absolutely nothing yeah uh nothing i don't feel guilty about anything uh relationship with my family uh i'm not really close to my family um i guess the person i'm closest to is my mom but you know i don't you know i don't i never really talk to her much uh i don't really know my dad that well so you know <makes clicking sounds with mouth> <whistling softly> <whistling softly> uh i guess my grandmother yeah she yeah she's uh she's very um xxx how should i say it uh she's very she's a thinker i put it like that like she's very insightful so um yeah i look to her for a lot of advice because she's been through a lot through a lot in her life and i feel like she you know she's been through a lot so she understands a lot so eh you know she's a very positive influence very easy uh maybe unsure i would say because right now i really don't know what direction i wanna go in with my life and there's been a lot of confusion with that um but you know it's not it's not something that overly affects me but you know it's always a thought in the back of my mind it feels <feel> feels like somehow maybe i'm running out of time and i know that's not like that's not xxx that's not a realistic thought because i don't see how you could ever run out of time but yeah i guess yeah just general not knowing what i want but i know like how do i cope with that how do i cope with that i uh i don't know i just do a lot of thinking a lot of soul searching it's not hard i mean i mean i'm it's xxx like i can't say it's hard because it's one of those things that i feel like it's necessary and you know certain things in life you just you're forced to face so it's harder to i think it's harder to avoid those type of things yeah no no no uh xxx today when i talked when i uh talked to my friend earlier yeah how would my best friend describe me uh i guess he would say i'm quiet uh uh guess he would describe as a nice guy uh guess insightful mm uh goofy and yeah oh i don't really think like that no ten or twenty years ago uh guess i would tell myself to stick with what what stick with what i love hmm uh i did uh acting workshop in um scrubbed_entry yeah i don't know it's always <al> always been an interest of mine and i decided why not you know just try it see how you like it what am i most proud of like an event or a an accomplishment i guess i pride myself on being independent mm yeah bye,0
<synch> yes i'm okay l_a mm uh there's a lot of variety um there's a lot of health-oriented stuff um there's all kinds of food to eat you can go to the desert you can go to the you can go anywhere i mean there's a lot and the weather's great the traffic um lately the change in weather it's kind of a little too unpredictable but it mainly the traffic and sometimes some rudeness of people uh i wouldn't say a lot just um occasionally uh it's nice to get a change of scenery and different things to do that maybe i wouldn't normally do different people um learning about different people different customs um depends i mean if it's a water real pretty water and xxx you know being in beautiful water um relaxing adventure i love adventure uh <laughter> uh some time ago i went to cayman islands and um went on i get seasick but my sister gave me some medication and i went on a boat and we snorkeled and there were two boats and i accidentally got back on the wrong boat um yeah and um they're really crazy they made me jump back into the water and swim to the right boat <laughter> and i thought i was gonna drown 'cause the water was kinda rough i was really shocked they they wanted me to do that yeah but i survived <laughter> yeah pretty good uh business management but also also hypnotherapy i didn't hear that other question um well i came from a serious kinda family so that just seems something that would be universal that would cover a lot of different subjects yes yeah but um yes and no i mean now i kinda wish it was something different um i like communication i love speaking and interviewing strangers um i'm very outgoing um and funny so probably would've been something more like either liberal arts communication that type of thing uh dream job would just be out there you know like some of these people maybe on t_v exploring different places and getting paid for it and eh always like a fun adventure uh interacting with people um doing things i haven't done before and um helping people you know on some way with what i do xxx that they can see you know that i'm uncoordinated and in some ways and you know they could be uncoordinated and have some fun too <laughter> uh i watch t_v i go work out um i go walking i recently got like a a bike that i kinda sort of fixed up um go do something new go to a festival go grocery shopping interact with friends call them see them that type of thing talk to strangers um depends on the situation there's a bunch of times i'm good at it um if it has to do with like traffic and cars it's a little more intense for me it's a little tougher or people who are like really rude you know with the way they cut you off almost <laughter> um luckily not you know i'm very assertive and maybe too much sometimes where if somebody does something really rude to me in a parking lot i'll i'll confront them on that sometimes um might've been with my sister um it had to do with um i'm not sure of the topic but um whatever she was saying wasn't right and we got in an argument it it sounds childish about who was right you know 'cause she thinks she's always the smarter one 'cause she's older uh sometimes it's frustrating 'cause it's like it's a no win situation she just wants to hammer on somebody 'til you know they acknowledge that she's right um other times i just let it go and let her rattle on 'cause it's it's kinda nonproductive uh i'm real close to i see my parents almost every weekend um more close to my mother um i have a twin sister i stay in touch with her even though she's out of town she lives out of town and i've got two other sisters so i stay in touch with all of 'em you know it's a mixed bag you know um we kinda have assertive aggressiveness in us a little bit <sigh> but also um well me <laughter> um and um ever i mean strangers sometimes my family you know they've done nice things for me um strangers have been very um sometimes unexpectedly very nice uh i could be shopping and um you know i'm maybe i can't reach something and some guy'll pop up behind me and you know without me saying anything just help me out um uh that type of thing or um if somebody's like kind of mean to me somebody'll like commiserate <laughter> you know and um xxx um i had a situation years ago with a neighbor where he was really nasty to me um 'cause he thought i didn't like his dog it was you know i'm not crazy about dogs but um he kinda flipped out for a year and a half and um just said very nasty things to me when other people weren't around um i wish i'd confronted that back then because i you know but it created a lot of anxiety for me 'cause i feel like i could've nipped it in the bud and to instead of having to deal with the um major stress from it now he and i don't talk at all i just feel it's best he's kind of odd hmm god there's been a lot um sometimes breaking up with somebody or um <sigh> yeah it's usually or getting rid of a friend that type of thing um sometimes i feel guilty about some of my past behavior with people um where maybe i wasn't as understanding um eh <sigh> when i was younger i stole things you know that's not the best behavior and um and it's stuff like that oh god there's a lot of 'em um i wish i could erase you know how um tough my dad was on us as children and um erase a lot of memories of men i dated that just didn't work out well at all and um yeah i can drop off like right away yeah cranky <laughter> irritated um snarky <laughter> um a bit out of sorts um i've had some anxiety uh with money um and relationships 'cause i haven't been in one for so long male <laughter> um just a lot of anxiety um mm yeah <sigh> take a deep breath um try and do positive things you know sometimes um eat healthier work out more um talk to my friend about it that type of thing try and look for interesting activities to do to distract me <sniffle> well not officially but i know <sigh> you know from mm things i've experienced that i've had <ha> i've you know i get very anxious in certain situations um yeah uh it's usually triggered by um sometimes if somebody gets really angry and crazy it triggers a lot of anxiety in me um if they're aggressive whether it be physically or verbally uh or sometimes if they're too much in my space <s> my uh space you know where i am it bothers me um yeah a long time ago it was ages ago maybe over ten years ago fifteen years ago um i was depressed <laughter> i mean i <laughter> know that's nothing to laugh about but i mean it's kinda in a circle um just to um wanted to be more positive and enjoy life more um feeling stuck in certain thoughts um having a lot of negative thoughts um feeling of hopelessness helplessness that type of thing xxx um i go occasionally it's a different type um i'll go see a hypnotherapist um sometimes to release <rel> release <rel> release anxiety that's in me yes i do very useful um a lot more awareness of myself and other people um learning more control more confidence um better self-esteem um willing to try even more things you know whether i know the outcome or not you know of the unknown i'll experiment a lot more scrubbed_entry um helping like at the twenty fifth mile handing out water and there were some people there who were doing that for the first time also some event at my sister's where there were just a couple of us and um i was cracking a lot of jokes sometimes i'm like really funny you know and i can't even believe myself you know i just go on and on you know and everyone starts laughing i'm not even trying to and i'm just saying like regular stories and people look at me funny and laugh <sniffle> yeah that um as a really decent loyal uh empathetic um deserving um supportive i'm hoping <laughter> um outgoing quirky type of person um well it'd be great to uh look even younger uh or be younger if that was humanly possible <laughter> um be even more patient with people i think um you know not get frustrated like if i think somebody's not very smart uh sometimes it's real frustrating for me to be around some types of people whoa um <laughter> uh <sigh> wow make a lot of money and plan for your future um and try and be as kind and patient with people as possible and have a lot of fun try new things i think of my mind and my perseverance that um i've changed a lot of things within my personality um uh i feel proud of volunteer work i xxx helped <hel> feel proud i've helped bunch of people lose weight declutter their homes um i've helped create a lot of positive change in people mhm oh okay yeah it was nice talking to you bye,0
<synch> yes i'm doing okay i'm from los angeles california the food the weather and the people mm um i don't know it's not too many things i really don't like about l_a maybe some of the bad people or some of the bad environments in l_a <laughter> um no not too much um i only been like to texas las vegas and that's pretty much it mhm um catching a airplane to houston texas like back and forth to visit my dad and going to las vegas a lot that's oh yeah um well when i was younger i used to go visit my dad and 'cause he used to live in houston texas and i used to catch the airplane a lot and that was a lot of fun i wasn't scared that was a lot of fun and i enjoyed that <laughter> um when i went to school i studied child development and nursing um i know i wanted to be somebody and when i went to school i wasn't sure what i wanted to be so i kinda took um nursing the l_v_n program first and then i didn't wanna be a nurse so i changed my major to child development and i graduated from that no i'm actually looking for work i'm unemployed right now my dream job would be probably doing something working with the kids opening up a nursery or something my own business in my mind it's simple but like in reality it seem like it's kinda difficult <laughter> sometimes i'm shy but i'm really an outgoing person and a people person hmm <laughter> um to relax i listen to some slow music i kinda like um have a quiet environment and maybe lay down watch a little t_v or something i'm very good at controlling my temper i don't like to get really angry or upset or get to where i'm fitting to hurt somebody <laughter> um when i really have arguments they're like because people don't agree to disagree and then it's over <o> like really petty it's like we might say oh it's just like my opinion and they don't agree with my opinion so we argue about that but it's like nothing really big or anything like that it's just stupid i don't even remember <laughter> um probably not working right now i need a job <laughter> yes um maybe <sigh> i don't really remember a situation i try to really think before i really handle a situation and i try to handle it in a my best positive way before i really do something i regret um being with somebody like a guy you know if i wanna continue a relationship with them or just be single mm um my relationship with my family i don't have i just really stay with my dad and i have a daughter and we just stay close all my family they're either in um houston texas or they're around but i don't really socialize with a lot of my family my dad because um i live with him right now i've been staying with him maybe about five <f> five to six years and he's just the only one i really look up to i don't really have nobody else around me to really look up to and that's it <laughter> scrubbed_entry she's in the fifth grade she's graduating she's going to the sixth grade and i'm kinda excited for that sometimes it's easy but uh sometimes it gets a little overwhelming um the hardest thing about being a parent is being a single parent it's just you always have somebody to bring you joy i enjoy always doing things with my daughter um it's just about making a lot of sacrifices and just always it's brings me so much joy being a parent well um my parents when i was younger they lived apart so my mom i don't know i'm i'm a much better parent 'cause i'm more interested about what my child wants to do i'm involved in her life her every step just i'm really fully involved my parents wasn't really that involved you know they had a drug problem so it just i had to mature a lot faster than a lot of other kids so it was um just my parents and um their drug addiction i wish i could erase that from my memory um now i cope with them well but um when i was growing up it just was rough it was very rough had to do a lot of things on my own um they wasn't involved in my decisions in life you know i just i didn't know how to really grow up and be a kid and which way to go or anything it just was like i was in a world by myself yeah oh it's very easy i sleep well every night i can sleep any time i sleep very well um a little sad but most of the time i'm very happy i'm just not happy with where i am in my life right now um not really i really i try to think very positive and try to do whatever i can every day to look for work and just stay positive and focused no i haven't no i haven't um the last time i felt very happy was when i graduated from um college i felt very happy that was one of the best things that happened in my life and that was the last time i was really really very happy like that i felt like i was on top of the world i felt like just overwhelmed with joy just everything was just so exciting for me that day i was just very very happy nothing could make me upset that day i was very happy and when i think about that day it just it's a very happy experience for me um right now i don't have <ha> really have a best friend i really try to i'm i tried to eliminate a lot of my friends because they wasn't really making a lot of positive choices so right now i'm just like um i really don't have any friends right now um my personality um i'm a happy person i'm a outgoing person and a positive person and a good mother um insecurities like um sometimes i feel like um i have a lot of weight on my shoulders or something i feel like i can't get through something i can't get to the next step sometimes or just feeling down sometimes well i did have a friend and she was like bipolar and i tried to really be her friend no matter um the disease she had but she wasn't a really good friend because she one day she start just um being very negative and just talking about me like we were enemies and everything and it didn't really make me feel too bad about myself but it just made me pick my friends very wisely yeah just being friends with certain people that don't have positive things going on with themselves or just don't it just when i notice things about people that should determine whether i wanna be their friend or not you know they might have bad qualities or just some bad habits they might smoke cigarettes or drink and i should notice that that's a red flag and i shouldn't be these people friends <laughter> yeah um to stay in school stay positive stay focused and surround myself with good positive people and just stay on the right track well i went um to a friend's house that i haven't seen since childhood and they it was just a lot of people over there and they had a barbecue and everything and i really enjoyed seeing my old friends that i didn't see in a long time and just being with my family and certain friends i really enjoyed because i'm really always in the house i

<laughter> uh i've traveled a bit europe and uh throughout the states yeah uh the new the new experiences it's always fun to travel to get a break from where you are and experiece <ex> have new experiences xxx and the great thing about it too is when you return home it kinda helps you reset your it kinda makes <ma> appreciate <appreci> makes you appreciate coming home as well well <laughter> you know i've been to spain and um england and italy different uh different places <laughter> probably barcelona loved barcelona the architecture and the the food <f> well food was uh was a part of it but just the the my experiences there were fantastic art history <sigh> i was always good artistically so it seemed a natural probably should've studied graphic design which i later got into to be um the star of my own t_v show <laughter> <laughter> i would be the most hilarious comedian making the entire country laugh at my brilliant comedic point of view on life <laughter> outgoing always have been as an actor as a uh kind of a comedian i do comedy <c> i'm a comedian as well and you have to be outgoing it's more fun <laughter> <sigh> try to take a peaceful walk do yoga much better i used to be i think when i was younger not so good lately i'm actually very proud of it i think the only time i really argue is on the phone with time warner cable <laughter> i don't know it's been awhile mm maybe not working hard enough some days um when you're a freelancer it's hard to keep at yourself to consistently be productive <laughter> um <whispering to himself> handled differently well <sigh> i don't know um can we come back to that one i can't think right now uh <whispering to himself> hardest xxx i've ever had to make uh probably once when i moved back to los angeles from boston and i had a girlfriend at the time and it was hard to leave i knew i had to had to come back but it i think it mm that particular move west was um felt it was calling me and that's where my connections were and i had to come home <sniffle> i think so yes <laughter> um erase from my memory <sigh> i don't know <kn> gosh i mean i don't know <ss> something you feel guilty about <ab> um maybe you know <laughter> uh maybe doing something when you're a little you've had a couple of extra drinks and you made out with a girl <laughter> that you shouldn't have eh uh it's pretty good i think um they're a challenge they're my folks are together got a sister my sister's in new york not the tightest family but you know eh i'm i'm proud <prou> i'm uh grateful for everything that i've derived from it i have a best friend that i went to college with and he's very smart i consistently call him uh when i'm having uh challenges life challenges um i will consistently call this specific <sp> well a few specific friends to get advice and i like <li> i like that i have a couple of friends who have been tremendously influential and supportive friends are good friends are very important sometimes uh most of the time not horrible but not amazing <ama> i mean it's okay <laughter> uh dragging tired <ti> uh not motivated or um yeah pretty good pretty good i'd say <s> um no i mean they're i think they're consistent with the way i've been for a while <sniffle> no no <deep breath> <sigh> i think when i get consistent work when i get a lot of do a lot of creative stuff get a lot done creatively uh i guess <laughter> i would hope something like um you know a charismatic fun loyal guy <laughter> um <ss> i wish i were more um more <m> more aggressive more consistent with um pursuing dreams i do a lot i do enough sometimes i get down on myself for not trying harder to do all the artistic things i love to do um well recently <laughter> recently i signaled into a lane <laughter> this woman was shouting at me i could hear it 'cause our windows were open it was a hot summer day and then later i drove up beside her and i said in a pleasant way i said i was just trying to signal to get into your lane 'cause she was cursing at me through the window prior to that and she lifted up her finger <f> just lifted up her finger <laughter> and gave me the finger and it was just it's funny sometimes you try to approach someone in just a normal loving way and all they have for you is hate and that did make me feel bad <laughter> <laughter> a little angry no 'cause i took the high road <laughter> but she <laughter> regrets i'm sure um just go out with friends make dinner recently a bunch of i had a you know small party at my house and one guy cooked food and we had a bunch of friends over and that's always fun um let's see never get too up or too down too high don't um accentuate the highs and lows because there's always a different it's a roller <roller> endless rollercoaster so you need to be prepared for the for that long ride creative things the creative the performances the comedic performances the commercials i've done the acting the stand-up comedy the graphic design all my creative filmmaking all my creative outlets that that are an expression of me buh bye <laughter>,0
<synch> yeah i am um good to moderate los angeles yeah i'm from um just a lot of different kinds of people and um eh i love the weather most of the time and um great creative scene i'm i'm really into music so um it's a great scene for that i i don't like driving <laughter> i don't know who does right i it's just it's just such a drag and uh getting from point a to point b is just a daily need and it doesn't get any easier it's too many people too many people <laughter> <laughter> i can't see your shoes um uh yeah when i can uh when <whe> when i can afford to um <sigh> just being somewhere else not having to drive usually most places have better public transportation um just i love <lo> i'm you know i'm a culture junkie i like experiencing different types of cultures so that's xxx um well you know i haven't been to that many places i've been to like mexico and italy it it's uh you know i wanna go to more places i wanna go to japan so that'll be that'll be interesting it's usually just with my family um it's my mom sometimes my girlfriend sometimes my brother and we just uh yeah we go to italy we spent two weeks there though that was cool yeah um living next to the best gelato shop in italy in we <w> we were in florence <f> when we were in florence spent uh spent a week in florence that was great very very good uh culture there as well art studied uh film and digital media 'cause uh i make music and i wanted to learn how to make music videos so it's something i'm trying to get into uh yeah yeah i mean i need to get a camera though that's the thing uh but um i mainly my main focus is music i studied film but my focus is music um yeah <y> sure i've been playing music i've been playing guitar uh keyboard bass drums for um for about twelve years now and uh i do uh production and songwriting i'm in a indie rock band scrubbed_entry um that's a great website i highly recommend it and it's uh it's mine so check it out uh international rockstar music producer and uh filmmaker director probably outgoing um just just feel like it's a way to get the best <be> most out of life uh just talking to people and learning about them and having them learn about you and care about you it's uh kinda just goes with the territory <caritor> territory <laughter> <laughter> yeah um i uh do meditation and uh it's not really hard 'cause it's fun and it it relaxes me and helps me focus at the same time which uh you know that that was a huge epiphany for me that you can relax and focus at the same time 'cause normally when i'm relaxing i'm i'm tuning out i'm focusing on something else but um to be able to combine those sensations was uh yeah i've been doing that for about uh three months now so yeah it is um almost too good at times <laughter> uh sometimes uh there's things that should be said that i that i don't um just because um you know it's like you're opening up a can of worms maybe one of your friends for example i got a problem with him but they don't have a problem with him necessarily 'cause he didn't do anything to them and uh i've had to deal with that in the past sort of a awkward social situation but um you know i make do um <makes sound with mouth> probably argued with uh the guitarist from my band uh we had a falling out we're not gonna be in a band together i mean we're still friends so at least there's that mm but um it was just basically about creative control of the project and how we're gonna prioritize it in in our lives and uh you know we just our priorities weren't the same and i got very upset so that was the end of that um <sigh> i felt good that it was definitive that it was you know a choice had been made on both parties uh also regretful that you know he didn't feel the way that i wanted him to feel about it which was excited about the project so the fact that he wasn't really in it kinda pissed me off um but i got over it um and you know i got some other people that are really really excited to be working with me you know even honored so you know i'm uh i'ma keep going thank you um <sigh> hmm i don't know i don't really i don't really have any regrets like that at the moment i can't really think of any um <deep breath> um when i was in high school i cheated on my girlfriend i didn't think it would mean anything at the time but i did it i i regret it but um you know xxx you know life happens you make some mistakes selfishness um being young and thinking it wouldn't matter um you know thinking you know you only live once and you know for eh it was probably for the best ultimately 'cause you know i love my current girlfriend and i would never do that to her so that was <wa> that was years ago but uh she was a nice girl she didn't deserve that so i regret it <deep breath> um shit geez um i guess uh whether to go to college or not 'cause uh i uh i had some projects going in l_a that i didn't really wanna shut off uh i i had a band going we had a manager um we were playing out a lot and i wasn't sure if i wanted to keep that going or go to school and start over and um i made the decision to go to school in santa cruz and and start a new life there for four years and it it was a difficult decision but i'm glad i did 'cause i met a lot of people a lot of people i'm still close with today that you know we work on stuff together and all that so it's good i agree it is good <laughter> thank you <laughter> um maybe i wish i could forget getting spanked in the parking lot when i was four by a danish babysitter uh you know on the abuse scale it's pretty low but it was somewhat humiliating and i i don't forget it so i have a pretty vivid picture of it and i'm i'm i'd be happier if it wasn't there it's positive they're supportive um they give me a hard time sometimes because they don't think that i keep things in perspective in terms of how i'm gonna support myself even though i do it's just um you know i have a a more long range picture than they do and i have faith in myself and the creative projects that i make so yeah there's a bit of tension there just 'cause you know they expect certain things from me and i expect them as well but i just have a different way of going about it than they might prefer but they're sweet people how do i cope with them uh i you know they're lovely people at their core you know um cope with them 'cause i love them i just uh you know at times i'll just uh go off on my own for a while and eh you know take a breather whatever you know xxx everyone makes you mad sometimes so <deep breath> challenging um <sigh> i just i try and it doesn't work um sometimes i have to take medication for it i have to take ambien something like that um yeah it's difficult <di> i'm someone who sleeps in late so i always get at least six or seven hours if i have to wake up early for something um i get nauseous sometimes i'll throw up in the morning um yeah i've had jobs where i'd wake up and you know vomit while i'm brushing my teeth it's horrible it does suck um it's kinda something i'm worried about you know i i kinda need to get some part time work while i'm not you know getting a steady pay flow for my music production so yeah <sigh> it's pretty rough <sigh> got some stuff i need to get over i'm not really sure how just not feeling good getting nervous when you know there's something stressful like a stressful work environment or just something i that doesn't sit well with me like being in a you know a a rushed and you know stressful work environment it just um unless it's about something that i care about you know like music or the arts it's just very hard to to give a shit frankly like and you know i i try to psych myself into giving a shit and it just makes me sick you know maybe i'll have a red bull or something and you know xxx my body doesn't want that in the morning it just i feel like my body rejects things and yeah okay i've been feeling okay very uh very reflective very contemplative you know there's gonna be some changes and there's gonna be some new people in my life some new people uh in my band um you know i'm gonna try to push myself but try to stay grounded at the same time 'cause you know i expect more from myself it's just pissing me off when my get my you know i basically feel like i'm shitting all over myself my body's shitting on me anyway just by being so um shitty <laughter> yeah no yes um i was diagnosed um about uh twelve years ago i haven't been in therapy since um they gave me zoloft and i didn't like it it made me feel worse than i do in the shittiest moments i was telling you about it it uh it made me feel numb um i don't wanna feel numb i wanna feel everything even if it sucks being forced to it was a private school they thought i was acting up thought i was a uppity kid i think i was just being a kid so yes i do um well i haven't been in in twelve years but i do think that it might be helpful for me in the future i thought you weren't a therapist that's a typical therapist question right there <laughter> um well yeah i uh uh i i kinda wanna go back to therapy it might help might help me find some solutions maybe maybe it's not a therapist i need maybe it's a life coach i have no idea but i'll be seeking help soon um yesterday i was watching a movie with my girlfriend and i looked over at her we smiled at each other and it was it was it was great yeah um very honest um sometimes brutally so but i'm a good guy i think that my friends all think i'm a good guy probably funny um open-minded um i guess well it's what i'm working on which is trying to improve my discipline and try to work through my body rejecting shittiness of the world <laughter> it gets better <sigh> um stay in shape it gets harder the longer you wait um don't give up on your dreams keep doing what you're doing my music you're welcome nice talking to you,0
